- en: 'In this part of the book, we will depart from traditional full-stack architectures
    and explore a special kind of full-stack architecture: **event-based applications**.
    Examples of event-based applications are apps that deal with real-time data, such
    as collaborative applications (e.g., Google Docs, online whiteboard, etc.) or
    financial applications (e.g., Kraken crypto exchange). We are first going to develop
    an event-based backend using **Express** and **Socket.IO**. Then, we are going
    to create a frontend to consume and send events. Lastly, we will add persistence
    and functionality to replay events to our app using **MongoDB**.'
