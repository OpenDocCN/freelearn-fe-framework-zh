With Angular 2, we're closer than ever. Over the past couple of years, there's been a lot of buzz around web components for quite some time in the web development community. New component-style directives in Angular 2 will change developers' workflows and their thinking about shared and reusable blocks of custom HTML in the shadow DOM. Ours is the first book that guides developers along this path. It's also a practical way to learn, giving readers the chance to build components of their own. With <span class="emphasis"><em>Mastering Angular 2 Components</em></span>, learners will get ahead of the curve in a new wave of web development by tightly focusing on an area that's the key to unlocking the powers of Angular development.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Mastering Angular 2 Components</em></span> teaches readers to think componentially. This rich guide to the new component-centric way of doing things in Angular teaches readers how to invent, build, and manage shared and reusable components for their web projects. This book will change how developers think about how to accomplish things in Angular 2, and the reader will be working on useful and fun example components throughout.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 1. Component-Based User Interfaces" href="part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S1">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Component-Based User Interfaces</em></span>, looks at a bit at the UI development history and provides a brief introduction to component-based user interfaces in general. We will see how Angular 2 handles this concept.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 2. Ready, Set, Go!" href="part0020.xhtml#aid-J2B81">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Ready, Set, Go!</em></span>, will get the reader started on their journey toward building an Angular 2 component-based application. It covers the basic elements of structuring an application with components.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 3. Composing with Components" href="part0028.xhtml#aid-QMFO1">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Composing with Components</em></span>, is where the reader will start to structure the user interface into its basic pieces. The reader will then go on to compose an application using components by organizing an application layout into components, establishing the composition of components using QueryList, and creating a reusable tab component to structure the application interface.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 4. No Comments, Please!" href="part0036.xhtml#aid-12AK82">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>No Comments, Please!</em></span>, is where the reader will learn how to build a commenting system using components. They will learn to create a component to list comments and also to create new comments.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 5. Component-Based Routing" href="part0039.xhtml#aid-1565U1">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Component-Based Routing</em></span>, explains how components react to routing and will enable the reader to add simple routing to the existing components in the task management application. The reader will also work on the login process and build an understanding to protect components using the router.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 6. Keeping Up with Activities" href="part0044.xhtml#aid-19UOO1">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Keeping Up with Activities</em></span>, covers the creation of components that will visualize activity streams on project and task level.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 7. Components for User Experience" href="part0049.xhtml#aid-1ENBI2">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Components for User Experience</em></span>, is where the reader will create many small reusable components that will have a great effect on the overall user experience of the task management application. This includes in-place editing of text fields, infinite scroll, popup notification, and drag and drop support.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 8. Time Will Tell" href="part0054.xhtml#aid-1JFUC2">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Time Will Tell</em></span>, focuses on creating time-tracking components that helps estimate time on a project and task level but also for users to log the time spent on tasks.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 9. Spaceship Dashboard" href="part0059.xhtml#aid-1O8H62">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Spaceship Dashboard</em></span>, focuses on creating components to visualize some data in the task management application using the third-party library Chartist.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 10. Making Things Pluggable" href="part0064.xhtml#aid-1T1401">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Making Things Pluggable</em></span>, is where the reader will learn about an approach to make components pluggable using a simple but powerful pattern. With a DIY plugin architecture for Angular 2 components, we make our task management system extensible.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 11. Putting Things to the Test" href="part0070.xhtml#aid-22O7C2">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Putting Things to the Test</em></span>, covers some basic approaches to testing Angular 2 components. We will see the options for mocking/overriding specific parts of a component for testing.</p><p><a class="link" title="Appendix A. Task Management Application Source Code" href="part0078.xhtml#aid-2ACBS1">Appendix</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Task Management Application Source Code</em></span>, contains all the information you'll need to download and install the source code that comes with this book. You'll also find instructions to use and troubleshoot the code in there.</p></div></div>
