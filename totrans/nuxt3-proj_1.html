			<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Introduction to Nuxt 3</h1>
			<p>Being in the<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> web development sphere for a good chunk of time teaches you the importance of evolution. It’s similar to watching a city grow. What started as a few buildings (or in our case, static web pages) has now turned into a sprawling metropolis with skyscrapers, interconnected transit systems, and vibrant hubs of activity. Similarly, our web development tools have transformed to keep up with the times. Nuxt <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>stands tall in this city of tools, especially for those of us who’ve been crafting with Vue.js. This section will act as a guided tour of Nuxt 3, taking you through its historical streets, its bustling downtown, and the architectural marvels that make developers like us tip our hats <span class="No-Break">in appreciation.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>The evolution of web development</h2>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>early days of the web, sites were straightforward. Think of them as the digital equivalent of a hand-drawn map. They showed you the way, but the journey was pretty much on you. As time passed, and as the web began to grow, demands became more complex. Websites transformed into web applications, and these applications needed to be dynamic, responsive, and interactive. It was no longer just about displaying information; it was about engagement, about creating experiences. In this dynamic landscape, Vue.js emerged as a beacon, simplifying the complexities and making developers’ lives a tad easier. But as any seasoned developer will tell you, there’s always room for improvement, <span class="No-Break">for evolution.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>The birth of Nuxt</h2>
			<p>Here’s a<a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> scenario many of us can relate to: You’re deep into a Vue.js project, appreciating its elegance, but there are moments when you think, “Could this be more streamlined? Could some repetitive tasks be automated?” This quest for efficiency is where Nuxt enters the story. Conceived by the visionary Chopin brothers, Nuxt was Vue.js with wings. It wasn’t just about adding features; it was about smart integration, about making the entire development process smoother. Imagine not having to set up routing manually for every page or having out-of-the-box solutions for SEO challenges. Nuxt was that fresh perspective, that innovative approach to challenges we’d taken as “just part of <span class="No-Break">the process.”</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Why Nuxt?</h2>
			<p>Simply put, if you’re <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>using Vue.js, Nuxt is your next logical step. It brings a suite of enhanced features. Nuxt comes packed with built-in tools such as automated routing, middleware support, universal (SSR and SPA) rendering, and flexible layouts. This means less boilerplate and more productivity. Nuxt seamlessly extends Vue’s capabilities, providing an integrated, efficient solution for building solid <span class="No-Break">web </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/></span><span class="No-Break">applications.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve explored Nuxt’s unique offerings in the Vue.js ecosystem, our next step is to delve into the architectural elements and foundational concepts of <span class="No-Break">Nuxt 3.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>The architecture and principles of Nuxt</h1>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> ever-evolving domain of web development, understanding the inner workings of a tool can be the key to mastering it. Nuxt 3, with its intricate<a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> design and powerful features, is no exception. For those of us who’ve been around the block, unraveling such complexities isn’t just a necessity – it’s a passion. Let’s embark on this deep dive into Nuxt 3, peeling back the layers to reveal the principles and architecture that <span class="No-Break">power it.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Built on top of Vue</h2>
			<p>At its<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> core, Nuxt 3 is built on top of Vue.js. While reactivity and component-based architectures have found their way into many modern frameworks, what sets Vue.js apart is its approachability. It’s designed in a way that both newcomers and seasoned developers can grasp its concepts with ease. But beyond the framework itself, Vue’s vibrant and supportive community plays a significant role. This positive community feedback creates the perfect foundation for Nuxt 3, allowing it to offer an enriched <span class="No-Break">development experience.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Universal rendering and static site generation</h2>
			<p>Remember <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>the days when we’d enter a website and there’d be this brief moment of emptiness before the content magically appeared? That’s client-side rendering in action. While it has its merits, this approach sometimes feels like entering a dimly lit room and waiting for the lights to slowly turn on. Universal rendering changes the game by merging the best of server-side and client-side rendering. With this approach, the content is pre-rendered on the server, providing immediate access upon entering the website. Once the page is loaded, the client-side script “hydrates” the page, enabling dynamic interactions and enhancing the user experience. <span class="No-Break">The benefits?</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Faster initial <span class="No-Break">page load</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Improved SEO</span></li>
				<li>Better overall <span class="No-Break">user experience</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>And <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>speaking of smooth web experiences, have you noticed that some websites are fast and don’t seem to have any glitches? Many of these are static sites. They’re like web pages that are ready to go as soon as you open them, without needing extra loading time. But modern static sites aren’t just about serving fixed content; they can be as dynamic and interactive as any other <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>site. Nuxt’s <strong class="bold">static site generation</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSG</strong>) capability means developers get the benefits of static sites (speed and security) and the dynamism of web apps. With Nuxt, crafting a static site is as intuitive as building any other application, but with the added advantages of performance <span class="No-Break">and security.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Performance optimizations</h2>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>world of web development, speed isn’t just a luxury; it’s a necessity. Users expect web pages to load quickly, and search engines reward fast-loading sites with better rankings. Recognizing this, Nuxt 3 has been designed with performance at its core. But what does this mean for developers and users? Let’s break down some of the key performance optimization techniques that Nuxt 3 employs to enhance both the developer and <span class="No-Break">user experience:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Code splitting</strong>: Instead <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>of sending a large JavaScript bundle, Nuxt 3 leverages Vite and Rollup to split code intelligently. This means users only download what’s necessary for the current page, reducing <span class="No-Break">load times.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tree shaking</strong>: Unnecessary<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> code can bloat applications. Tree shaking ensures that only the code that’s used gets included in the final bundle. It’s like trimming the branches of a tree to keep it healthy <span class="No-Break">and vibrant.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Link prefetching</strong>: While<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> a user is browsing a page, Nuxt 3 is already hard at work, prefetching resources for linked pages. This proactive approach means subsequent pages load <span class="No-Break">almost instantly.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Nuxt uses Vite under <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>the hood. Vite is a tool that changes how we think about web development. It starts up almost instantly, which means no more waiting to start working. When you change your code, Vite updates it right away so that you can see your changes immediately. It has a straightforward build system, which means less time figuring things out and more time coding. Plus, it’s designed to be fast in every way, making the whole development <span class="No-Break">process smoother.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we covered Nuxt 3’s architecture, its advantages in rendering, and its focus on performance. As we proceed, we’ll shift from theory to hands-on practice, guiding you through setting up your first Nuxt <span class="No-Break">3 environment.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Installing and setting up the Nuxt 3 environment</h1>
			<p>Before diving<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> into the depths of Nuxt 3, it’s essential to set up a conducive environment. Think of it as preparing the soil before planting a tree. The better the preparation, the healthier the tree will be as it grows. In this section, we’ll walk you through the prerequisites and installation steps, ensuring you have a robust foundation to start your Nuxt <span class="No-Break">3 journey.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Prerequisites</h2>
			<p>To work with Nuxt 3, there<a id="_idIndexMarker018"/> are a few things you need to have installed and set up. Based on the Nuxt 3 official website, here are <span class="No-Break">the prerequisites:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Node.js</strong>: It’s<a id="_idIndexMarker019"/> essential to ensure you have Node.js installed and that it’s at least version 18.10.0. To check whether Node.js is installed, as well as its version, run the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span><pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ node –v</strong></pre><p class="list-inset">If you see a version number, that means Node.js is installed. If it’s below 18.10.0 or if Node.js isn’t installed, you can download the latest version from the official<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> Node.js <span class="No-Break">website: </span><a href="https://nodejs.org/"><span class="No-Break">https://nodejs.org/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p></li>				<li><strong class="bold">Package manager</strong>: While <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>npm comes bundled with Node.js, for this guide, we’ll be using pnpm. It’s efficient and fast and ensures that packages are shared across projects. To install it, run the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span><pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ npm install -g pnpm</strong></pre></li>				<li><strong class="bold">Code editor</strong>: While you can use<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> any code editor, we recommend VS Code. It’s versatile, supports a plethora of extensions, and is widely adopted in the <span class="No-Break">developer </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker023"/></span><span class="No-Break">community.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this section, you set up your Nuxt 3 environment. Next, you’ll build a “Hello Nuxt” application and explore the basic <span class="No-Break">project structure.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Creating your first “Hello Nuxt” app</h1>
			<p>In this section, we’ll take<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/><a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> the first step together – that is, crafting your very first Nuxt application. By the end, you’ll have a running application and a foundational understanding of the Nuxt <span class="No-Break">project structure.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Initialization – the steps to create a new Nuxt project</h2>
			<p>Here are the steps<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> for <span class="No-Break">initialization :</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create a new starter project by designating a space for your project. Open your Terminal (macOS/Linux) or terminal (Windows), and run the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span><pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ pnpm dlx nuxi@latest init hello-nuxt</strong></pre><p class="list-inset">Upon executing this command, you’ll be prompted to select a package manager. <span class="No-Break">Choose </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pnpm</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p></li>			</ol>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we dived into the transformative world of Nuxt 3 and its role in modern web development. We started by discussing its architecture and its built-in performance optimizations, which include code splitting, tree shaking, and link prefetching. We also touched upon its capability for server-side rendering and SSG. Then, we walked through the steps of setting up the Nuxt 3 environment, including the prerequisites and initialization steps for creating a “Hello Nuxt” app. We also got a taste of the Nuxt project structure and discussed some recommended extensions for VS Code to enhance the <span class="No-Break">development experience.</span></p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we’ll build a simple portfolio website using Nuxt 3 and Tailwind CSS, further enhancing our hands-on experience with <span class="No-Break">the framework.</span></p>
