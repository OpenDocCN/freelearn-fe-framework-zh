It has taken the JavaScript community by storm and has inspired sweeping changes in a number of existing JavaScript application frameworks and architectures.</p><p>Unfortunately, there still aren't many examples of great architecture. Most tutorials and books focus on small components and examples, leaving the question of larger applications and component hierarchies unanswered. That is what this book seeks to change.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Thinking in Components">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Thinking in Components</em></span>, looks at the need to think of entire interfaces as a composition of small components and how to build them using modern ES6 JavaScript.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Working with Properties and State">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Properties and State</em></span>, takes a comprehensive look at many aspects of property and state management, sharing a few more ES6 tricks along the way.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Saving and Communicating Data">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Saving and Communicating Data</em></span>, looks at reactive programming using event emitters and unidirectional flow of data.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Styling and Animating Components">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Styling and Animating Components</em></span>, takes a look at how components can be styled and animated both inline and using stylesheets.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Going Material!">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Going Material!</em></span>, explores material design and applies what you learn to our set of components.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Changing Views">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Changing Views</em></span>, looks at ways of transitioning between different views with routing and animation.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Rendering on the Server">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Rendering on the Server</em></span>, takes a look at the process of rendering components through nodes and some ways of structuring server-side application code.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. React Design Patterns">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>React Design Patterns</em></span>, explores different architectures such as Flux and Redux.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Thinking of Plugins">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Thinking of Plugins</em></span>, looks at how to build components with dependency injection and extension points.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Testing Components">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Testing Components</em></span>, explores various ways of ensuring that components are error-free and that changes to parts of an application don't have cascading effects on other parts.</p></div></div>
