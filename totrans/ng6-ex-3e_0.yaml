    to you and lend a helping hand in your quest to learn Angular. Angular has gone
    mainstream and has become the ubiquitous platform for web and mobile development.

    learn, and there is a whole new world to explore for developers getting started.
    Getting started with Angular can be overwhelming even for a seasoned AngularJS
    developer. Too many terms will be thrown at you: such as TypeScript, Transpiler,
    Shim, Observable, Immutable, Modules, Exports, Decorators, Components, Web Component,
    and Shadow DOM. Relax! We are trying to embrace the modern web, and everything
    new that is here is to make our lives easier. Lots of these concepts are not specific
    to Angular itself but highlight the direction in which the web platform development
    is moving. We will try our best to present these concepts in a clear and concise
    manner, helping everyone understand how these pieces fit into this big ecosystem.
    Learning by examples has its advantages, for example, you will immediately get
    to see the concept explained in action. This book follows the same pattern as
    its predecessor. Using the **Do It Yourself** (**DIY**) approach, we build multiple
    simple and complex applications using Angular.'

    applications. Angular is now at release 6, with significant changes through its
    previous versions. This is a unique web development book that will help you get
    to grips with Angular and explore a powerful solution for developing single page
    applications.

- en: We will be building our apps in the TypeScript language; therefore, it would
    be preferable if you have an IDE that makes development with TypeScript easy.
    IDEs such as Atom, Sublime, WebStorm, and Visual Studio (or VS Code) are great
    tools for this purpose.
