    This book will help you develop robust, reusable, and fast user interfaces with
    ReactJS. This book will ensure a smooth and seamless transition to the ReactJS
    ecosystem. The books is full of hands on real applications. From setup to implementation,
    testing, and deployment: discover the new frontier of front-end web development.
    ReactJS, popularly known as V of MVC architecture, is developed by the Facebook
    and Instagram developers. We will take a deep dive on the ReactJS world and explore
    the unidirectional data flow, virtual DOM, DOM difference, which ReactJS leverages
    in order to increase the performance of the UI. You will learn the key concepts
    of ReactJS in a step-by-step process. You will also learn ES6 syntaxes used in
    ReactJS for the future browsers, with the transpiling techniques to be used in
    order to support it in current browsers.'

    how you can test JS-based applications and deploy them. In addition to this, you
    will also be developing a full-fledged application using Flux architecture. You
    will also learn about Redux, which lets you understand how you can manipulate
    the data in ReactJS applications easily, by introducing some limitations on the
    updates. With ample codes covering the concepts and their theoretical explanations
    coupled with screenshots of the application, you will gain a deep understanding
    of ReactJS.

    and how to make it work on your web page. It will demonstrate how to create your
    first React component.'

    simple react component, created in the first chapter, built with the JSX syntax.
    It''ll explain the purpose of JSX and demystify its usage. It will compare some
    older template techniques to JSX and try to clarify some common questions about
    it.'

    components.'

    Events"), *Stateful Components and Events*, covers components that have state,
    practices to communicate between them, and how to respond to ''users'' input/events
    in order to have UI reflect this state. This chapter also covers how the state
    changes your React UI performance with the Virtual DOM.'

    explores what is the life cycle of such a React component. Furthermore, we will
    also dig into the future ECMA Script syntaxes and few changes that the React community
    also used from version 0.13.0\. For this, we will review some ES6 and ES7 features
    within the react library.'

    client-side web applications. It complements React''s composable view components
    by using a unidirectional data flow. There is an in-depth explanation of all the
    components of the FLUX architecture (view, stores, action, and dispatchers).'
