<p class="mce-root"><span>This book explores the development of full-stack JavaScript web applications by combining the power of React with industry-tested server-side technologies, such as Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The JavaScript landscape has been growing rapidly for some time now. With an abundance of options and resources available in relation to full-stack JavaScript web applications, it is easy to get lost when you need to choose from these frequently changing entities, learn about them, and make them work together to build your own web applications. In an attempt to address this pain point, this book adopts a practical approach to help you set up and build a diverse range of working applications using the popular MERN stack.</span></p>

<p><a href="7514f26d-29e1-46e2-ac46-7515b2c3a6d0.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em><span>Extending the Marketplace for Orders and Payments</span></em><span>, focuses on extending the online marketplace we built in the previous chapter by implementing capabilities for buyers to add products to a shopping cart, checkout, and place orders, and for sellers to manage these orders and have payments processed from the marketplace application. We will also integrate Stripe to collect and process payments.</span></p>
<p><a href="48801a75-cf6a-4eb8-b294-65314e749e9d.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em><span>Adding Real-Time Bidding Capabilities to the Marketplace</span></em><span>, focuses on teaching you how to use the MERN stack technologies, along with Socket.IO, to easily integrate real-time behavior in a full-stack application. We will do this by incorporating an auctioning feature with real-time bidding capabilities in the MERN marketplace application.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="5fbf9367-1086-4c60-92ec-2ca0795a4a95.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>,</span> <em><span>Integrating Data Visualization with an Expense Tracking Application</span></em><span>, focuses on using MERN stack technologies along with Victory—a charting library for React—to easily integrate data visualization features in a full-stack application. We will extend the MERN skeleton application to build an expense tracking application that will incorporate data processing and visualization features for expense data recorded by a user over time.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="d3f14062-4c41-497c-9627-dc22075fb8fb.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>,</span> <em><span>Building a Media Streaming Application</span></em><span>, focuses on extending the MERN skeleton application to build a media uploading and streaming application using MongoDB GridFS. We will start by building a basic media streaming application, allowing registered users to upload video files that will be stored on MongoDB and streamed back so that viewers can play each video in a simple React media player.</span> </p>
<p class="mce-root"><span><a href="d10817c4-6f74-4ef2-90f4-182466e95b33.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>,</span> <em><span>Customizing the Media Player and Improving SEO</span></em>, upgrades the media viewing capabilities of our media application with a custom media player and autoplay media list. We will implement customized controls on the default React media player, add a playlist that can be autoplayed, and improve SEO for the media details by adding selective server-side rendering with data for just the media detail view.</p>
<p><span><a href="4f633dd6-f392-490d-b3a6-eb5430b58ec8.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>,</span> <em><span>Developing a Web-Based VR Game</span>,</em><span> uses React 360 to develop a three-dimensional <strong>virtual reality</strong> (<strong>VR</strong>)-infused game for the web.

                    <h1 class="header-title">Conventions used</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>addItem(item, cb) {<br/>    let cart = []<br/>    if (typeof window !== "undefined") {<br/>      if (localStorage.getItem('cart')) {<br/>        cart = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cart'))<br/>      }<br/>      cart.push({<br/>        product: item,<br/>        quantity: 1,<br/>        shop: item.shop._id<br/>      })<br/>      localStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(cart))<br/>      cb()<br/>    }<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>&lt;Grid container spacing={24}&gt;<br/>      &lt;Grid item xs={6} sm={6}&gt;<br/>            <strong>&lt;CartItems checkout={checkout}</strong><br/><strong>                  setCheckout={showCheckout}/&gt;</strong><br/>      &lt;/Grid&gt;<br/> {checkout &amp;&amp; <br/>      &lt;Grid item xs={6} sm={6}&gt;<br/>        &lt;Checkout/&gt;<br/>      &lt;/Grid&gt;}<br/>&lt;/Grid&gt;</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>yarn add --dev @babel/preset-react </strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
