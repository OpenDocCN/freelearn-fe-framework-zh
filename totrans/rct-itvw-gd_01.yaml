    in this section, which is essential if you want to give yourself the best possible
    chance of doing well during the interview stage of your job search as a React
    developer. This is an area that can essentially have a big impact on whether or
    not you find yourself in a position where you have a constant stream of job opportunities

    is the first step to covering all of your bases—so to speak—by preparing you for

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are now going to talk about the difference between a resume and a cover letter,
    so let’s get started. Essentially, a resume is a form of Word or PDF document
    that basically showcases a person’s work history. This is where you will be presenting
    all of your career experience up to the most recent date. Resumes can cover areas
    of interest such as your education, work experience, achievements, and skills.
    The main purpose of having a resume in the first place is to present your knowledge
    and qualifications to companies for whom you are trying to get hired, in the hopes
    that your profile will be strong enough to get you an interview. The first step
    is always to convince a hiring manager that you are a candidate worth shortlisting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Cover letters, on the other hand, are documents that are no longer than one
    page. Their sole purpose is to accompany your resume, and both are oftentimes
    submitted at the same time for a role. A cover letter is not as formal as a resume,
    meaning that you can be a lot more expressive with your wording here. This is
    your chance to introduce yourself to the company and explain why above all else
    you are the stand-out candidate they should seriously consider hiring. We should
    use cover letters to highlight our best skills and experiences, with the goal
    of ultimately convincing the hiring manager and company that our resume and personality
    make us a potential good culture fit and that we deserve to be invited for an
    interview, at least so that we can prove ourselves. You can find a great example
    of a cover letter in *Figure 1**.1*:'

    why they are essential for job searchers. It is far too easy to believe that you

    and that your time would be better spent on other areas of the job search process
    such as doing job applications. We are going to break this down even further so
    that we can highlight the areas where having a stand-out resume and cover letter

    us. This essentially gives us a blank canvas where we are able to really sell
    ourselves to a new person and convince them that we are high value and worth getting
    to know. Resumes and cover letters are pretty much the introduction documents
    akin to saying “hi” to someone new or shaking hands when you have met someone
    new whom you would like to know. With well-written documents, we are able to set
    ourselves apart from the other candidates and hopefully put ourselves at the top
    of the shortlist.

    with charisma and as much belief and positivity as you can create. Sometimes,
    it can be hard if, for whatever reason, you are feeling low or bad on the day,
    but you have to find a way to overcome it. I have gone to interviews when I was
    not feeling the greatest, and it negatively impacted the interview. Similarly,
    I have had interviews go well because I was in the right frame of mind on the
    day and knew what I was going to say. A strategy that works well for me is listening
    to music or meditating beforehand. Feeling relaxed or fired up for a challenge
    is really going to give you the strength you need to put your best persona forward
    on the day.

    we are. Resumes and cover letters are used to screen new candidates to see which
    ones are worth interviewing. If the content we are putting forward is poorly written,
    outdated, fake, or has too many grammatical, spelling, and other inaccuracies,
    then we are highly unlikely to get to the interview stage. In these instances,
    it can be common to experience rejections or even ghosting when you never hear
    back from them. Of course, there are many reasons why this could be happening;
    we just ran through a few scenarios.

    words that were all in capital letters, and the spellchecker did not see the typos.
    That’s why it’s essential that you double- and triple-check what you are writing.
    Even getting someone else to proofread it is a good option. They might spot something
    you missed.

    resume and cover letter can increase your job prospects even more. If you create
    a tailor-made resume and cover letter for each role you apply for, then you can
    demonstrate that you have taken the time to read through their job description
    and that you are capable of showcasing how your current technology stack is a
    perfect match for the job. A custom profile is always going to stand out from
    a generic one. Sure—it might take a bit longer to create something custom for
    each application, but if that leads to even a few interviews, then it was clearly
    worth the effort.

    resumes leading to more interviews compared to the generic ones that I just used
    everywhere. So, let’s say that I am applying for a React role. To better my chances
    of success, I would try to highlight all the React experience that I have. So,
    I would add links to projects that I have created in React either on GitHub or
    a live website. I am also a technical writer, so adding links to articles on React
    that I have published would help me stand out even more.

    something about React, such as—for example—“integrated a Redux store and optimized

    There have been times when I was feeling low after facing multiple rejections
    and ghosting experiences, which happens to all of us. In those situations, it’s
    probably best to take a break from interviews, which is what I forced myself to

    a candidate’s abilities and accomplishments, some hiring managers might be wary

- en: Firstly, it’s important that our resumes are well formatted and easy on the
    eye. Obviously, you should not have any spelling or grammatical errors because
    this can damage your image and credibility. It has to look professional. Bullet
    points tend to be the most effective way to describe each job role. Just break
    them down into points, and describe what you did in the role and how it had a
    positive effect on the business. Avoid writing paragraphs because they will make
    your resume too long, and hiring managers are more likely to avoid them because
    it slows down their shortlisting process. This is advice I received after talking
    to lots of hiring managers and recruiters. Overall, three to four bullet points
    tend to perform the best in this situation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In most scenarios, we will be listing our work experiences in reverse chronological
    order. So, the most recent roles are at the top, and past roles are lower down.
    Keeping our resume updated and with as few gaps as possible is going to help us
    in the long run. To demonstrate our talents and abilities, it is a good idea to
    give particular examples of our successes. To measure our accomplishments, a possible
    solution would be to use figures and percentages to show the gains that we managed
    to achieve during our time working there. Putting in content that is related to
    React is essential because we are applying for React roles, after all. So, the
    more React-related experience that you can put in the experience section, the
    better. In one example, you could show how your experience has advanced. Let’s
    say that you worked on a code base that used the legacy class syntax, and then
    you updated it to use the latest Hooks syntax. That shows that you can work with
    legacy code bases and are familiar with the latest syntax too, and these are great
    traits for a programmer to have: problem-solving and being able to adapt to different
    situations.'

    university degrees that we hold should be presented there. Mentioning any certifications,
    courses, and training can add further weight to our profile. When it comes to
    the skills section, it’s best to include both hard and soft skills. Hard skills
    include programming-related areas such as JavaScript, React, and Node.js. Soft
    skills, on the other hand, include areas such as communication, teamwork, proactiveness,
    and so on.

    keywords that highlight your skills and experiences in relation to the job that
    you are applying for. Many companies use **applicant tracking system** (**ATS**)
    resume scanner tools for finding candidates. So, if you can put in keywords such
    as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which could also be on their job description, then
    you have a good chance of getting a message from a hiring manager. I try to have
    as many keywords as possible in mine because you never know—it could make all
    the difference and determine if you are one of the candidates who gets shortlisted.

    not a possibility on a resume, which has to be more formal. Let’s explore some
    areas for writing good cover letters. The aim here should be to have good engagement,
    so have a strong fun introduction that briefly explains who you are, what you
    can do, and why you are applying for the role at that company. Don’t forget to
    mention the company name and the job title on the job description you saw.

    as possible to engage with the person who is going to be reading it, and try to
    write in a relaxed manner. All of this will show that you are a good fit for the
    role. Use this time to make it as personal as possible. Through this, we can show
    how well we have researched the company by showing lots of passion and motivation

    With these points, we can produce a strong and successful cover letter by adding
    these important aspects. When I write cover letters, my aim is to make them intriguing,
    engaging, and social. I work toward trying to captivate the reader so that they
    can imagine what it would be like to work with me. You can have the best programming
    skills in the world, but at some point, you will have to interact with people,
    so it’s an area that needs to be worked on as well. A good combination of hard
    and soft skills is most desirable.

    the whole thing from top to bottom. A job description is like a brief for a project.
    Go through it to ensure that you know exactly what is needed and don’t miss anything.
    Look for areas that mention qualifications, education, skills, experience, and
    so on. You don’t always need to meet all the specifications. In fact, it’s quite
    common for people to get hired even when they don’t possess all of the skills
    and experience, which has happened to me many times. Job descriptions are like
    guidelines; oftentimes, the winning candidate does not have everything required
    but is more than capable of learning on the job or in their free time. Keep a
    look out for those ATS keywords because the more of them that you find, the better
    your chances of getting to an interview.

    volunteer work completed and the degrees we’ve earned. The aim is to determine
    the abilities we applied and the impact we had in each position. There are questions
    that we can ask ourselves, such as how we improved productivity or performance
    and if we completed the project on time and within budget. It’s crucial that we
    list these achievements and any others that we can think of on our resume. Anything
    that makes us credible and an ideal candidate is well worth mentioning. In my
    early days, I listed all the experiences I could think of because this might have
    had some relevance to the job I applied for, such as—for example—if you had a
    job in customer service in retail, which might be a completely different job role
    from the one you’re applying for now, but it is evidence that you can negotiate

    which is a very effective and professional copywriting tool.

    I can recall one interview where one of the interviewers asked me what I knew
    about the company, and I tried to avoid answering because I knew nothing. I was
    super prepared for any programming-related questions because that was a weakness
    that I wanted to fix. I did not think that it was worth the time to gain deep
    insights into the company because—let’s be honest here—the first-stage interview
    might not go anywhere, and then you will feel like you wasted your time. However,
    it has to be done on the off chance that you do get asked, and your failure to
    come up with an answer gets you removed from the shortlist.

    supplement, not rehash, our resume. Utilize your cover letter to showcase your

    Put emphasis on how you can benefit the company, not on what you want in return.
    It is far better to be a giver than a taker because givers provide value, and
    that is a quality worth having in someone. Figuring out which tone of voice to
    use when you write can be challenging as well. Work on matching the way the company
    comes across; striking the right balance between formal and informal is important.

    meeting group for you. You could save time and stress by doing some research and
    planning beforehand. Find out which clubs in your region are focused on the topics
    that interest you or the abilities you wish to improve on first. Be sure the group’s
    aims are in line with your own, and any feedback from former participants can
    also assist in simplifying the decision. You don’t want to be in a predicament
    where you become bogged down in the middle of the event. Make an effort to ask
    friends or acquaintances for recommendations so that you can join the meetups
    that are ideal for your needs.

    you can make it simpler. Meetups offer excellent chances for networking with experts
    in your area and creating meaningful connections that might result in recommendations
    for job openings. This not only aids in the development of lasting relationships
    but also broadens your personal network and raises your chances of landing the
    ideal employment. Meeting individuals in your business who share your interests
    or hobbies through meetings is a quick and easy approach to give yourself an edge
    in the job search.

    finding employment. This is due to the fact that a recommendation from an existing
    worker or friend can provide you access to a company’s internal operations, including
    new job listings and career development chances. You can ensure that your name
    is put up for any opportunities that come up both inside and outside of your sector
    by participating in meetings and other networking events. This offers you an advantage
    over rivals who don’t have as many testimonials praising them and gives you more
    possibilities. When it comes to taking charge of your own professional trajectory,
    taking advantage of references ought to be a top priority.

    Even while it could seem frightening, it does not need to be. Look at the individuals
    who are already a part of your network, such as friends or acquaintances, to start.
    It’s crucial that you pick a person who is knowledgeable about your qualifications
    and network. Then, ask them if they are aware of any openings or employment that
    match your qualifications. Consider attending local professional meetings as another
    opportunity to network and learn about available employment in your area. Take
    the chance to meet some lifelong, meaningful contacts at these events since you
    never know whom you could run into. Above all, be persistent when asking for references,
    be focused, and be enthusiastic.

    interview stage is where you are ultimately going to show your new prospective

    extremely lucky, you might not have to do anything extremely technical because
    maybe the company that is hiring you does not believe in doing these types of
    code assessments. That’s a possibility, and I have interviewed with companies
    who thought that way, but it’s not always a guarantee. So, always be prepared
    no matter what. In terms of preparation, what I would do is work on my technical
    stack as much as possible—so, essentially, write as much code as I can and build
    apps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I have done in these situations is just practice building **create, read, update,
    delete** (**CRUD**) applications that connect to a database with a React frontend,
    and then taking it a step further and integrating third-party libraries such as
    Day.js, which is used for converting dates, or a chart library such as recharts.js,
    which is used for data visualization. These are tools that get used in real-world
    projects, so learning them now makes you better prepared for those take-home code
    challenges that could require you to use them.

    your technical stack. The other area that you should work on is data structures
    and algorithms. There are courses that you can do on Udemy, or you can study this
    subject elsewhere. Next, you have to find the time to practice online on coding
    platforms such as LeetCode. It can be tedious, but unfortunately, we need to be
    prepared for anything. On some job boards, I have seen forms that ask you how
    prepared you are for a code test, which is part of the application process when
    you are submitting your resume. And I can imagine that if you say that you are
    not that prepared, then you might not even make the shortlist. So, the moral of
    the story: get yourself to a place where you feel you are confident enough to
    at least attempt doing a code test. It’s impossible to be 100% ready because there
    are so many different variables to take into account. At the very least, we should
    be prepared enough to give it a good go.'

    what it’s like to work for a bad company that has a toxic work environment. Not
    all companies are going to give you that dream experience, which is why it is
    worth investing some time to do research. It is normal to use websites such as
    Glassdoor when researching a company so that we can see what the feedback and
    reviews are like. It always fills you with hope and excitement when you read positive
    reviews; however, the same isnt true of the negative ones. Even though we all

    establishing a solid first impression. In my case, at the very least I shave or
    trim my beard before an interview so that I don’t look unkempt. Getting a haircut
    or a trim is advisable too. These days, we are fortunate because if it’s a video
    interview or phone call, then it’s not too bad. You can get away with looking
    a bit rough. Personally, I would not take that risk with a face-to-face, though;
    wear aftershave or perfume, but not so much that it becomes overwhelming.

    chances of getting the job. Also, it is a great method to improve conversation
    during the interview. My interviews have had much better conversations when I
    was feeling confident and prepared. It does not always happen straight away, although
    confidence can be increased during the interview. I have found this to be especially
