- en: As Angular continues to reign as one of the top JavaScript frameworks, more
    developers are seeking out the best way to get started with this extraordinarily
    flexible and secure framework. *Learning Angular* , now in its fifth edition,
    will show you how you can use Angular to achieve cross-platform high performance
    with the latest web techniques, extensive integration with modern web standards,
    and **integrated development environments** ( **IDEs** ).

- en: This book is especially useful for those new to Angular and will help you to
    get to grips with the bare bones of the framework needed to start developing Angular
    apps. You’ll learn how to develop apps by harnessing the power of the Angular
    **command-line interface** ( **CLI** ), write unit tests, style your apps by following
    the Material Design guidelines, and finally, build them for production.

    and debugging in Angular, and new real-life examples. By the end of this book,
    you’ll not only be able to create Angular applications with TypeScript from scratch,
    but also enhance your coding skills with best practices.
