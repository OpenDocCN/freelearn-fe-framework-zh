			<p><strong class="bold">React Testing Library</strong> (<strong class="bold">RTL</strong>) is a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for testing the <strong class="bold">Document Object Model</strong> (<strong class="bold">DOM</strong>) output of components. This book will show you how to utilize this modern, user-friendly tool to test React components, explaining its benefits to reduce risk in React applications. </p>
			<p>The book demonstrates code snippets that will allow you to implement RTL with ease, helping you understand the guiding principles of the DOM Testing Library to write tests from the user's perspective. You'll explore the advantages of testing components from the perspective of individuals who will actually use your components, and you'll use <strong class="bold">Test-Driven Development</strong> (<strong class="bold">TDD</strong>) to drive the process of writing tests. As you advance, you'll discover how to add RTL to React projects, test components using the Context API, and also learn how to write UI end-to-end tests using the popular Cypress library. Throughout this book, you'll work with practical examples and useful explanations to be able to confidently create tests that don't break when changes are made.</p>
			<p>By the end of this React book, you will have learned all you need to be able to test React components with ease.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for?</h1>
			<p>This book is for software engineers, quality engineers and React developers who want to learn about modern practices used for testing React components using the latest testing tool, RTL. Basic knowledge of React development is required to get the most out of this book..</p>

You will learn how to properly structure tests using the API. You will look at presentational components and write some initial tests. Finally, we will learn how to use the debug method to assist us in the process of writing tests.</p>
			<p><a href="B16887_03_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor046"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Testing Complex Components with React Testing Library</em>, will help you understand how to test more complex React components. You will learn how to simulate user interactions with Fire Event and the user event module. You will learn how to use TDD to drive the process of writing tests. Finally, you will unit test components that interact with APIs.</p>
			<p><a href="B16887_04_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Integration Testing and Third-Party Libraries in Your Application</em>, teaches you how to test components in various React applications. You will learn how to test integrated components and how to test components using the Context API. Finally, you will test components using popular third-party libraries such as GraphQL and Redux.</p>
			<p><a href="B16887_05_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor083"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Refactoring Legacy Applications with React Testing Library</em>, will teach you strategies for dealing with breaking changes while refactoring legacy React applications. You will learn how to update production packages while using RTL tests to guide you in resolving breaking changes. You will also learn how to convert tests written in Enzyme or ReactTestUtils to RTL.</p>
			<p><a href="B16887_06_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor094"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Additional Tools and Plugins for Testing</em>, will help you learn additional tools to enhance your ability to test React applications using RTL.</p>
