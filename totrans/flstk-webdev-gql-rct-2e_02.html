			<h1 id="_idParaDest-16"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Chapter 1</em>: Preparing Your Development Environment</h1>
			<p>The application we are going to build in this book will be a simplified version of Facebook, called <strong class="bold">Graphbook</strong>. We will allow our users to sign up and log in to read and write posts and chat with friends, similar to what we can do on common social networks. </p>
			<p>When developing an application, being well-prepared is always a requirement. However, before we start, we need to put our stack together. In this chapter, we will explore whether our techniques work well with our development process, what we need before getting started, and which tools can help us when building software.</p>
			<p>This chapter explains the architecture for our application by going through the core concepts, the complete process, and preparing for a working React setup.</p>
			<p>This chapter covers the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Architecture and technology</li>
				<li>Thinking critically about how to architect a stack</li>
				<li>Building the React and GraphQL stack</li>
				<li>Installing and configuring Node.js</li>
				<li>Setting up a React development environment with webpack, Babel, and other requirements</li>
				<li>Debugging React applications using Chrome DevTools and React Developer Tools</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>The source code for this chapter is available in the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-GraphQL-and-React-Second-Edition/tree/main/Chapter01">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-GraphQL-and-React-Second-Edition/tree/main/Chapter01</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Understanding the application architecture</h1>
			<p>Since its <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>initial release in 2015, GraphQL has become the new alternative to the standard SOAP and REST APIs. GraphQL is a specification, like<a id="_idIndexMarker001"/> SOAP and REST, that you can follow to structure your application and data flow. It is so innovative because it allows you to query specific fields of entities, such as users and posts. This functionality makes it very good for targeting <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>multiple platforms at the same time. Mobile apps may not need all the data that's displayed inside the browser on a desktop computer. The query you send consists of a JSON-like object that defines which information your platform requires. For example, a query for a <strong class="source-inline">post</strong> may look like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">post {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  id</p>
			<p class="source-code">  text</p>
			<p class="source-code">  user {</p>
			<p class="source-code">    user_id</p>
			<p class="source-code">    name</p>
			<p class="source-code">  } </p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>GraphQL resolves the correct entities and data, as specified in your query object. Every field in GraphQL represents a <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>function that resolves to a value. Those functions are called <strong class="bold">Resolver functions</strong>. The return value could be just the corresponding database value, such as the name of a user, or it could be a date, which is formatted by your server before returning it.</p>
			<p>GraphQL is completely database agnostic and can be implemented in any programming language. To skip the step of implementing a GraphQL library, we are going to use Apollo, which<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> is a GraphQL server for the Node.js ecosystem. Thanks to the team behind Apollo, this is very modular. Apollo works with many of the common Node.js frameworks, such as Hapi, Koa, and Express.js.</p>
			<p>We are going to use<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> Express.js as our basis because it is used on a wide scale in the Node.js and GraphQL communities. GraphQL <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>can be used with multiple database systems and distributed systems to offer a straightforward API over all your services. It allows developers to unify existing systems and handle data fetching for client applications.</p>
			<p>How you combine your databases, external systems, and other services into one server backend is up to you. In this book, we are going to use a MySQL server via Sequelize as our data storage. SQL is <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>the most well-known and commonly used database query language, and with Sequelize, we<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> have a modern client library for our Node.js server to connect with our SQL server.</p>
			<p>HTTP is <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>the standard protocol for accessing a GraphQL API. It also applies to Apollo Servers. However, GraphQL is not fixed to one network protocol. Everything we have mentioned so far is everything important for the backend.</p>
			<p>When we get to the frontend <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>of our <strong class="bold">Graphbook</strong> application, we are mainly going to use React. React is a JavaScript UI framework that was released by Facebook that has introduced <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>many techniques that are now commonly used for building interfaces on the web, as well as on native environments.</p>
			<p>Using React comes with a bunch of significant advantages. When building a React application, you always split your code into many components, targeting their efficiency and ability to be reused. Of course, you can do this without using React, but it makes it very easy. Furthermore, React teaches you how to update application states, as well as the UI, reactively. You never update the UI and then the data separately.</p>
			<p>React makes rerendering very efficient by using a virtual DOM, which compares the virtual and actual DOM and updates it accordingly. Only when there is a difference between the virtual and real DOM does React apply these changes. This logic stops the browser from recalculating the<a id="_idIndexMarker012"/> layout, <strong class="bold">Cascading Style Sheets</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSS</strong>), and other computations that negatively impact the overall performance of your application.</p>
			<p>Throughout this book, we are going to use the Apollo client library. It naturally integrates with React and our Apollo Server.</p>
			<p>If we put all this together, the result is the main stack consisting of Node.js, Express.js, Apollo, SQL, Sequelize, and React.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>The basic setup</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> basic setup for making an application work is the<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> logical request flow, which<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> looks as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer006" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_1.1_B17337.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1 – Logical request workflow&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.1 – Logical request workflow</p>
			<p>Here is how<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> the logical request <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>flow works:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The client requests our site.</li>
				<li>The Express.js server handles these requests and serves a static HTML file.</li>
				<li>The client downloads all the necessary files, according to this HTML file. The files also include a bundled JavaScript file.</li>
				<li>This bundled JavaScript file is our React application. After executing all the JavaScript code from this file, all the required Ajax alias GraphQL requests are made to our Apollo Server.</li>
				<li>Express.js receives the requests and passes them to our Apollo endpoint.</li>
				<li>Apollo <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>queries all the requested data from all the available systems, such as our SQL server or third-party services, merges the data, and sends it back as JSON.</li>
				<li>React can render the JSON data as HTML.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>workflow is the basic setup for making an application work. In some cases, it makes sense to offer server-side rendering for our client. The server would need to render and send all <strong class="source-inline">XMLHttpRequests</strong> itself before returning the HTML to the client. The user will save doing one or more round trips if the server sends the requests on the initial load. We will focus on this topic later in this book, but that is the application architecture in a nutshell. With that in mind, let's get hands-on and set up our development environment.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Installing and configuring Node.js</h1>
			<p>The first step of <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>preparing our project is to install Node.js. There are two ways to do this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>One option is to install <strong class="bold">Node Version Manager</strong> (<strong class="bold">NVM</strong>). The benefit of using NVM is that <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>you can easily run multiple versions of Node.js side by side, which handles the installation process for you on nearly all UNIX-based systems, such as Linux and macOS. Within this book, we do not need the option to switch between different versions of Node.js.</li>
				<li>The other option is to install Node.js via the package manager of your distribution if you are<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> using Linux. The official PKG file is for Mac, while the MSI file is for Windows. We are going to use the regular Linux package manager for this book as it is the easiest method. <p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>find the <strong class="bold">Downloads</strong> section of Node.js at the following link: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a>.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We are going to <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>be using the second option here. It covers the regular server configurations and is easy to understand. I will keep this as short as possible and skip all the other options, such as Chocolatey for Windows and Brew for Mac, which are very specialized for those specific operating systems.</p>
			<p>I assume that you are using a Debian-based system for ease of use with this book. It has got the normal APT package manager and repositories for easily installing Node.js and MySQL. If you are not using a Debian-based system, you can look up the matching commands to<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> install Node.js at <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/">https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/</a>.</p>
			<p>Our project is<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> going to be new so that we can use Node.js 14, which is the current LTS version:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">First, let's add the correct repository for our package manager by running the following command:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo bash -</strong></p></li>
				<li>Next, we must install Node.js and the build tools for native modules using the following command:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">apt-get install -y nodejs build-essential</strong></p></li>
				<li>Finally, let's open a Terminal and verify that the installation was successful:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">node --version</strong></p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">Installing Node.js via the package manager will automatically install npm.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Great! You <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>are now set to run server-side JavaScript with Node.js and<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> install Node.js modules for your projects with npm. </p>
			<p>All the dependencies that our project relies on <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>are available at <a href="https://npmjs.com">https://npmjs.com</a> and can be installed with npm or Yarn. We will rely on npm as it is more widely used than Yarn. So, let's continue and start using npm to set up our project and its dependencies. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Setting up React</h1>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>development environment for our project is ready. In this section, we are going to install and configure React, which is the primary aspect of this chapter. Let's start by creating a new directory for our project:</p>
			<p class="source-code">mkdir ~/graphbook</p>
			<p class="source-code">cd ~/graphbook</p>
			<p>Our project will use Node.js and many npm packages. We will create a <strong class="source-inline">package.json</strong> file to install and manage all the dependencies for our project. It stores information about the project, such as the version number, name, dependencies, and much more.</p>
			<p>Just run <strong class="source-inline">npm init</strong> to create an empty <strong class="source-inline">package.json</strong> file:</p>
			<p class="source-code">npm init</p>
			<p>npm will ask some questions, such as asking for the package name, which is, in fact, the project name. Enter <strong class="source-inline">Graphbook</strong> to insert the name of your application in the generated <strong class="source-inline">package.json</strong> file.</p>
			<p>I prefer to start with version number 0.0.1 since the default version number that npm offers with 1.0.0 represents the first stable release for me. However, it is your choice regarding which version you use here.</p>
			<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker031"/> skip all the other questions by pressing the <em class="italic">Enter</em> key to save the default values of npm. Most of them are not relevant because they just provide information such as a description or the link to the repository. We are going to fill in the other fields, such as the scripts, while working through this book. You can see an example of the command line in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer007" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_1.2_B17337.jpg" alt="Figure 1.2 – npm project setup&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.2 – npm project setup</p>
			<p>The first and most crucial dependency for this book is React. Use npm to add React to our project:</p>
			<p class="source-code">npm install --save react react-dom</p>
			<p>This command installs two npm packages from <a href="https://npmjs.com">https://npmjs.com</a> into our project folder under <strong class="source-inline">node_modules</strong>.</p>
			<p>npm automatically edited our <strong class="source-inline">package.json</strong> file since we provided the <strong class="source-inline">--save</strong> option and added those packages with the latest available version numbers.</p>
			<p>You might be wondering why we installed two packages, even though we only needed React. The <strong class="source-inline">react</strong> package only provides React-specific methods. All React Hooks, such as <strong class="source-inline">componentDidMount</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong>, and even React's component class, come from this package. You need this package to write any React application.</p>
			<p>In most<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> cases, you won't even notice that you have used <strong class="source-inline">react-dom</strong>. This package offers all the functions to connect the actual DOM of the browser to your React application. Usually, you use <strong class="source-inline">ReactDOM.render</strong> to render your application at a specific point in your HTML and only once in your code. We will cover how to render React later in this book.</p>
			<p>There is also a function called <strong class="source-inline">ReactDOM.findDOMNode</strong>, which gives you direct access to a DOMNode, but I strongly discourage using this since any changes on DOMNodes are not available in React itself. I have never needed to use this function, so try to avoid it if possible. Now, that our npm project has been set up and the two main dependencies have been installed, we need to prepare an environment that bundles all the JavaScript files we are going to write. We will focus on this in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Preparing and configuring webpack</h2>
			<p>Our <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>browser requests an <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> file when accessing our application. It specifies all the files that are required to run our application. We need to create this <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> file, which we serve as the entry point of our<a id="_idIndexMarker034"/> application:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a separate directory for our <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> file:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">mkdir public</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">cd public</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">touch index.html</strong></p></li>
				<li>Then, save this inside <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong>:<p class="source-code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;head&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, </p><p class="source-code">       initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;title&gt;Graphbook&lt;/title&gt;</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;/head&gt;</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;body&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;/body&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;/html&gt;</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>can <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>see, no JavaScript is loaded here. There is only one <strong class="source-inline">div</strong> tag with the <strong class="source-inline">root</strong> ID. This <strong class="source-inline">div</strong> tag is the DOMNode that our application will be rendered in by <strong class="source-inline">ReactDOM</strong>.</p>
			<p>So, how do we get React up and running with this <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> file?</p>
			<p>To accomplish this, we need to use a web application bundler, which will prepare and bundle all our application assets. All the required JavaScript files and <strong class="source-inline">node_modules</strong> are bundled and minified; SASS and SCSS preprocessors are transpiled to CSS, as well as being merged and minified.</p>
			<p>A few application bundler packages are available, including webpack, Parcel, and Gulp. For our use case, we will use webpack. It is the most common module bundler and has a large community surrounding it. To bundle our JavaScript code, we need to install webpack and all its dependencies, as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">npm install --save-dev @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react clean-webpack-plugin css-loader file-loader html-webpack-plugin style-loader url-loader webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server</p>
			<p>This command adds all the development tools to <strong class="source-inline">devDependencies</strong> in the <strong class="source-inline">package.json</strong> file. We will need these to bundle our application. They are only installed in a development environment and are skipped in production.</p>
			<p>If you are<a id="_idIndexMarker037"/> not<a id="_idIndexMarker038"/> already aware, setting up webpack can be a bit of a hassle. Many options can interfere with each other and lead to problems when you're bundling your application. Now, let's create a <strong class="source-inline">webpack.client.config.js</strong> file in the root folder of your project.</p>
			<p>Enter the following code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">const path = require('path');</p>
			<p class="source-code">const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');</p>
			<p class="source-code">const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require('clean-webpack-plugin');</p>
			<p class="source-code">const buildDirectory = 'dist';</p>
			<p class="source-code">const outputDirectory = buildDirectory + '/client';</p>
			<p class="source-code">module.exports = {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  mode: 'development',</p>
			<p class="source-code">  entry: './src/client/index.js',</p>
			<p class="source-code">  output: {</p>
			<p class="source-code">    path: path.join(__dirname, outputDirectory),</p>
			<p class="source-code">    filename: 'bundle.js'</p>
			<p class="source-code">  },</p>
			<p class="source-code">  module: {</p>
			<p class="source-code">    rules: [</p>
			<p class="source-code">      {</p>
			<p class="source-code">        test: /\.js$/,</p>
			<p class="source-code">        exclude: /node_modules/,</p>
			<p class="source-code">        use: {</p>
			<p class="source-code">          loader: 'babel-loader'</p>
			<p class="source-code">        }</p>
			<p class="source-code">      },</p>
			<p class="source-code">      {</p>
			<p class="source-code">        test: /\.css$/,</p>
			<p class="source-code">        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']</p>
			<p class="source-code">      }</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ]</p>
			<p class="source-code">  }, </p>
			<p class="source-code">  devServer: {</p>
			<p class="source-code">    port: 3000,</p>
			<p class="source-code">    open: true</p>
			<p class="source-code">  },</p>
			<p class="source-code">  plugins: [</p>
			<p class="source-code">    new CleanWebpackPlugin({</p>
			<p class="source-code">      cleanOnceBeforeBuildPatterns: [path.join(__dirname, </p>
			<p class="source-code">      buildDirectory)]</p>
			<p class="source-code">    }),</p>
			<p class="source-code">    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({</p>
			<p class="source-code">      template: './public/index.html'</p>
			<p class="source-code">    })</p>
			<p class="source-code">  ]</p>
			<p class="source-code">};</p>
			<p>The webpack <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>configuration file<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> is just<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> a regular JavaScript file where you can require <strong class="source-inline">node_modules</strong> and custom JavaScript files. This is the same as everywhere else inside Node.js. Let's quickly go through all of the main properties of this configuration. Understanding these will make future custom <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>webpack configs much easier. All the important <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>points are<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> explained here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">HtmlWebpackPlugin</strong>: This automatically generates an HTML file that includes all the webpack bundles. We pass our previously created <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> as a template.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">CleanWebpackPlugin</strong>: This empties all of the provided directories to clean the old build files. The <strong class="source-inline">cleanOnceBeforeBuildPatterns</strong> property specifies an array of folders that are cleaned before the build process is started.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">entry</strong> field tells webpack where the starting point of our application is. This file needs to be created by us.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">output</strong> object specifies how our bundle is called and where it should be saved. For us, this is <strong class="source-inline">dist/client/bundle.js</strong>.</li>
				<li>Inside <strong class="source-inline">module.rules</strong>, we match our file extensions with the correct loaders. All the JavaScript files (except those located in <strong class="source-inline">node_modules</strong>) are transpiled by Babel as specified by <strong class="source-inline">babel-loader</strong> so that we can use ES6 features inside our code. Our CSS gets processed by <strong class="source-inline">style-loader</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">css-loader</strong>. There are many more loaders for JavaScript, CSS, and other file extensions available.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">devServer</strong> feature of webpack enables us to run the React code directly. This includes hot reloading code in the browser without rerunning a build or refreshing the browser tab.<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">If you need a more detailed <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>overview of the webpack configuration, have a look at the official documentation: <a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/">https://webpack.js.org/concepts/</a>.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>With this in mind, let's move on. We are missing the <strong class="source-inline">src/client/index.js</strong> file from our webpack configuration, so let's create it, as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">mkdir -p src/client</p>
			<p class="source-code">cd src/client</p>
			<p class="source-code">touch index.js</p>
			<p>You can leave this file empty for the moment. It can be bundled by webpack without content inside. We are going to change it later in this chapter.</p>
			<p>To spin up our development webpack server, we will add a command to <strong class="source-inline">package.json</strong> that we can run using <strong class="source-inline">npm</strong>.</p>
			<p>Add the following line to the <strong class="source-inline">scripts</strong> object inside <strong class="source-inline">package.json</strong>:</p>
			<p class="source-code">"client": "webpack serve --devtool inline-source-map --hot --config webpack.client.config.js"</p>
			<p>Now, execute <strong class="source-inline">npm run client</strong> in your console and watch how a new browser window opens. We are running <strong class="source-inline">webpack serve</strong> with the newly created configuration file.</p>
			<p>Sure, the <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>browser<a id="_idIndexMarker047"/> is still empty, but if you inspect the HTML with Chrome DevTools, you will see that we have already got a <strong class="source-inline">bundle.js</strong> file and that our <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> file was taken as a template.</p>
			<p>With that, we've learned how to include our empty <strong class="source-inline">index.js</strong> file with the bundle and serve it to the browser. Next, we'll render our first React component inside our template <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> file.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Rendering your first React component</h2>
			<p>There <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>are many best practices for React. The central philosophy behind it is to split our code into separate components where possible. We are going to cover this approach in more detail in <a href="B17337_05_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor123"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Reusable React Components and React Hooks</em>.</p>
			<p>Our <strong class="source-inline">index.js</strong> file is the main starting point of our frontend code, and this is how it should stay. Do not include any business logic in this file. Instead, keep it as clean and slim as possible.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">index.js</strong> file should include the following code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">import React from 'react';</p>
			<p class="source-code">import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';</p>
			<p class="source-code">import App from './App';</p>
			<p class="source-code">ReactDOM.render(&lt;App/&gt;, document.getElementById('root'));</p>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker049"/> release of <em class="italic">ECMAScript 2015</em> introduced the <strong class="source-inline">import</strong> feature. We can use it to load our <strong class="source-inline">npm</strong> packages – <strong class="source-inline">react</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">react-dom</strong> – and our first custom React component, which we must write now.</p>
			<p>Of course, we need to cover the traditional <strong class="source-inline">Hello World</strong> program.</p>
			<p>Create the <strong class="source-inline">App.js</strong> file next to your <strong class="source-inline">index.js</strong> file and ensure it contains the following content:</p>
			<p class="source-code">import React from 'react';</p>
			<p class="source-code">const App = () =&gt; {</p>
			<p class="source-code">    return (</p>
			<p class="source-code">        &lt;div&gt;Hello World!&lt;/div&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">    )</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">export default App</p>
			<p>Here, we exported a single stateless function called <strong class="source-inline">App</strong> that is then imported by the <strong class="source-inline">index.js</strong> file. As we explained previously, we are now actively using <strong class="source-inline">ReactDOM.render</strong> in our <strong class="source-inline">index.js</strong> file.</p>
			<p>The first parameter of <strong class="source-inline">ReactDOM.render</strong> is the component or function that we want to render, which is the exported function displaying the <strong class="bold">Hello World!</strong> message. The second parameter is the browser's <strong class="source-inline">DOMNode</strong>, where it should render. We receive <strong class="source-inline">DOMNode</strong> with a plain <strong class="source-inline">document.getElementById</strong> JavaScript.</p>
			<p>We defined our root element when we created the <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> file. After saving the <strong class="source-inline">App.js</strong> file, webpack will try to build everything again. However, it should not be able to do that. webpack will encounter a problem when bundling our <strong class="source-inline">index.js</strong> file because of the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;App /&gt;</strong> tag syntax we are using in the <strong class="source-inline">ReactDOM.render</strong> method. It was <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>not transpiled to a normal JavaScript function.</p>
			<p>We configured webpack to load Babel for our JavaScript file but did not tell Babel what to transpile and what not to transpile.</p>
			<p>Let's create a <strong class="source-inline">.babelrc</strong> file in the root folder that contains the following content:</p>
			<p class="source-code">{</p>
			<p class="source-code">  "presets": ["@babel/env","@babel/react"]</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You may have to restart the server because the <strong class="source-inline">.babelrc</strong> file is not reloaded when changes are made to the file. After a few moments, you should see the standard <strong class="bold">Hello World!</strong> message in your browser.</p>
			<p>Here, we told Babel to use <strong class="source-inline">@babel/preset-env</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">@babel/preset-react</strong>, which we installed together with webpack. These presets allow Babel to transform specific syntax, such as JSX. We can use those presets to create normal JavaScript that all browsers can understand and that webpack can bundle.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Rendering arrays from React state</h2>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Hello World!</strong> is a must <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>for every good programming book, but this is not what we are aiming for when we use React.</p>
			<p>A social network such as Facebook or Graphbook, which we are writing now, needs a newsfeed and an input to post news. Let's implement this.</p>
			<p>Since this is the first chapter of this book, we will do this inside <strong class="source-inline">App.js</strong>.</p>
			<p>We should work with some fake data here since we have not set up our GraphQL API yet. We can replace this with real data later.</p>
			<p>Define a<a id="_idIndexMarker052"/> new variable above the <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> exported <strong class="source-inline">App</strong> function, like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">const initialPosts = [</p>
			<p class="source-code">    {</p>
			<p class="source-code">        id: 2,</p>
			<p class="source-code">        text: 'Lorem ipsum',</p>
			<p class="source-code">        user: {</p>
			<p class="source-code">        avatar: '/uploads/avatar1.png',</p>
			<p class="source-code">        username: 'Test User'</p>
			<p class="source-code">        }</p>
			<p class="source-code">    },</p>
			<p class="source-code">    {</p>
			<p class="source-code">        id: 1,</p>
			<p class="source-code">        text: 'Lorem ipsum',</p>
			<p class="source-code">        user: {</p>
			<p class="source-code">        avatar: '/uploads/avatar2.png',</p>
			<p class="source-code">        username: 'Test User 2'</p>
			<p class="source-code">        }</p>
			<p class="source-code">    }</p>
			<p class="source-code">];</p>
			<p>We are going to render these two fake posts in React. To prepare this, change the first line of the <strong class="source-inline">App.js</strong> file to the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">import React, { useState } from 'react';</p>
			<p>This ensures that the <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> function of React is imported and accessible by our stateless function.</p>
			<p>Replace the current content of your <strong class="source-inline">App</strong> function with the following code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">const [posts, setPosts] = useState(initialPosts);</p>
			<p class="source-code">return (</p>
			<p class="source-code">  &lt;div className="container"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">    &lt;div className="feed"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">      { initialPosts.map((post, i) =&gt; </p>
			<p class="source-code">        &lt;div key={post.id} className="post"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">          &lt;div className="header"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">            &lt;img src={post.user.avatar} /&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">            &lt;h2&gt;{post.user.username}&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">          &lt;/div&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">          &lt;p className="content"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">            {post.text}</p>
			<p class="source-code">          &lt;/p&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">        &lt;/div&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">      )}</p>
			<p class="source-code">    &lt;/div&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  &lt;/div&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">)</p>
			<p>Here, we<a id="_idIndexMarker053"/> initiated a <strong class="source-inline">posts</strong> array inside the function via the React <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> function. It allows us to have a state without writing a real React class; instead, it only relies on raw functions. The <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> function expects one parameter, which is the initial value of the state variable. In this case, this is the constant <strong class="source-inline">initialPosts</strong> array. This returns the <strong class="source-inline">posts</strong> state variable and a <strong class="source-inline">setPosts</strong> function, which you can use to update the local state.</p>
			<p>Then, we iterated over the <strong class="source-inline">posts</strong> array with the <strong class="source-inline">map</strong> function, which again executes the inner callback function, passing each array item as a parameter one by one. The second parameter is just called <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> and represents the index of the array element we are processing. Everything that's returned from the <strong class="source-inline">map</strong> function is then rendered by React.</p>
			<p>We <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>merely returned HTML by putting each post's data in ES6 curly braces. These curly braces tell React to interpret and evaluate the code inside them as JavaScript.</p>
			<p>As shown in the preceding code, we are relying on the posts that were returned by the <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> function. This data flow is very convenient because we can update the state at any point in our application and the posts will rerender. The important thing is that this will only work by using the <strong class="source-inline">setPosts</strong> function and passing the updated array to it. In this case, React notices the change of state and rerenders the function.</p>
			<p>The preceding method is much cleaner, and I recommend this for readability purposes. When saving, you should be able to see rendered posts. They should look like this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer008" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_1.3_B17337.jpg" alt="Figure 1.3 – Unstyled demo posts&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.3 – Unstyled demo posts</p>
			<p>The images I am using here are freely available. You can use any other material that you have got if the<a id="_idIndexMarker055"/> path matches the string from the <strong class="source-inline">posts</strong> array. You can find those images in the official GitHub repository for this book. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>CSS with webpack</h2>
			<p>The posts <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>in the preceding figure have not been designed yet. I have already added CSS classes to the HTML our component returns.</p>
			<p>Instead of using CSS to make our posts look better, another method is to use CSS-in-JS using packages such as styled components, which is a React package. Other alternatives include Glamorous and Radium. There are numerous reasons for and against using such libraries. With those other tools, you are not able to use SASS, SCSS, or LESS effectively. I need to work with other people, such as screen and graphics designers, who can provide and use CSS, but do not program styled components. There is always a prototype or existing CSS that can be used, so why should I spend time translating this into styled components CSS when I could just continue with standard CSS?</p>
			<p>There <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>is no right or wrong option here; you are free to implement the styling in any way you like. However, in this book, we will keep using good old CSS.</p>
			<p>What we have already done in our <strong class="source-inline">webpack.client.config.js</strong> file is specify a CSS rule, as shown in the following code snippet:</p>
			<p class="source-code">{</p>
			<p class="source-code">  test: /\.css$/,</p>
			<p class="source-code">  use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],</p>
			<p class="source-code">},</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">style-loader</strong> injects your bundled CSS right into the DOM. <strong class="source-inline">css-loader</strong> will resolve all <strong class="source-inline">import</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">url</strong> occurrences in your CSS code.</p>
			<p>Create a <strong class="source-inline">style.css</strong> file in <strong class="source-inline">/assets/css</strong> and fill in the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">body {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  background-color: #f6f7f9;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  margin: 0;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">p {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  margin-bottom: 0;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">.container {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  max-width: 500px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  margin: 70px auto 0 auto;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">.feed {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  background-color: #bbb;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  padding: 3px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  margin-top: 20px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">.post {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  background-color: #fff;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  margin: 5px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">.post .header {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  height: 60px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">.post .header &gt; * {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  display: inline-block;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  vertical-align: middle;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">.post .header img {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  width: 50px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  height: 50px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  margin: 5px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">.post .header h2 {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  color: #333;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  font-size: 24px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  margin: 0 0 0 5px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">.post p.content {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  margin: 5px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  padding: 5px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  min-height: 50px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>Refreshing your browser will leave you with the same old HTML you had previously.</p>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>problem occurs because webpack is a module bundler and does not know anything about CSS; it only knows JavaScript. We must import the CSS file somewhere in our code.</p>
			<p>Instead of using <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> and adding a <strong class="source-inline">head</strong> tag, we can use webpack and our CSS rule to load it right into <strong class="source-inline">App.js</strong>. This solution is very convenient since all the required CSS throughout our application gets minified and bundled. Webpack automates this process.</p>
			<p>In your <strong class="source-inline">App.js</strong> file, add the following behind the React <strong class="source-inline">import</strong> statement:</p>
			<p class="source-code">import '../../assets/css/style.css';</p>
			<p>webpack magically rebuilds our bundle and refreshes our browser tab.</p>
			<p>With that, you have successfully rendered fake data via React and styled it with bundled CSS from webpack. It should look something like this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer009" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_1.04_B17337.jpg" alt="Figure 1.4 – Styled demo posts &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.4 – Styled demo posts </p>
			<p>The output looks very good already.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Event handling and state updates with React</h2>
			<p>For this project, it would be great to have a simple <strong class="source-inline">textarea</strong> where we can click a button and <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>then add a new post to the static <strong class="source-inline">posts</strong> array we wrote in the <strong class="source-inline">App</strong> function.</p>
			<p>Add the following code above the <strong class="source-inline">div</strong> tag that contains the <strong class="source-inline">feed</strong> class:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;div className="postForm"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;                      </p>
			<p class="source-code">    &lt;textarea value={postContent} onChange={(e) =&gt; </p>
			<p class="source-code">      setPostContent(e.target.value)}</p>
			<p class="source-code">      placeholder="Write your custom post!"/&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">    &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" /&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  &lt;/form&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;/div&gt;</p>
			<p>You can use forms in React without any problems. React can intercept the submit event of requests by giving the form an <strong class="source-inline">onSubmit</strong> property, which will be a function to handle the logic.</p>
			<p>We are passing the <strong class="source-inline">postContent</strong> variable to the <strong class="source-inline">value</strong> property of <strong class="source-inline">textarea</strong> to get what <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>is called a <strong class="bold">controlled input</strong>.</p>
			<p>Create an empty string variable to save the <strong class="source-inline">textarea</strong> value by using the <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> function from React:</p>
			<p class="source-code">const [postContent, setPostContent] = useState('');</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">postContent</strong> variable is already being used for our new <strong class="source-inline">textarea</strong> since we specified it in the <strong class="source-inline">value</strong> property. Furthermore, we directly implemented the <strong class="source-inline">setPostContent</strong> function in our post form. This is used for the <strong class="source-inline">onChange</strong> property or any event that is called whenever you type inside <strong class="source-inline">textarea</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">setPostContent</strong> function receives the <strong class="source-inline">e.target.value</strong> variable, which is the DOM accessor for the value of <strong class="source-inline">textarea</strong>, which is then stored in the state of the React function.</p>
			<p>Look at your browser again. The form is there, but it is not pretty, so add the <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>following CSS:</p>
			<p class="source-code">form {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  padding-bottom: 20px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">form textarea {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  width: calc(100% - 20px);</p>
			<p class="source-code">  padding: 10px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  border-color: #bbb;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">form [type=submit] {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  border: none;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  background-color: #6ca6fd;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  color: #fff;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  padding: 10px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  border-radius: 5px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  font-size: 14px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">  float: right;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>The last step is to implement the <strong class="source-inline">handleSubmit</strong> function for our form. Add it straight after the <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>state variables and the <strong class="source-inline">return</strong> statement:</p>
			<p class="source-code">const handleSubmit = (event) =&gt; {</p>
			<p class="source-code">    event.preventDefault();</p>
			<p class="source-code">    const newPost = {</p>
			<p class="source-code">        id: posts.length + 1,</p>
			<p class="source-code">        text: postContent,</p>
			<p class="source-code">        user: {</p>
			<p class="source-code">            avatar: '/uploads/avatar1.png',</p>
			<p class="source-code">            username: 'Fake User'</p>
			<p class="source-code">        }</p>
			<p class="source-code">    };</p>
			<p class="source-code">    setPosts([newPost, ...posts]);</p>
			<p class="source-code">    setPostContent('');</p>
			<p class="source-code">};</p>
			<p>The preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>code looks more complicated than it is, but I am going to explain it quickly.</p>
			<p>We needed to run <strong class="source-inline">event.preventDefault</strong> to stop our browser from actually trying to submit the form and reload the page. Most people that come from jQuery or other JavaScript frameworks will know this.</p>
			<p>Next, we saved our new post in the <strong class="source-inline">newPost</strong> variable, which we want to add to our feed.</p>
			<p>We faked some data here to simulate a real-world application. For our test case, the new post ID is the number of posts in our state variable plus one. React wants us to give every child in the ReactDOM a unique ID. By counting the number of posts with <strong class="source-inline">posts.length</strong>, we simulate the behavior of a real backend giving us unique IDs for our posts.</p>
			<p>The text for our new post comes from the <strong class="source-inline">postContent</strong> state variable.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, we do not have a user system right now that our GraphQL server can use to give us the newest posts, including the matching users and their avatars. We can simulate this by having a static user object for all the new posts we create.</p>
			<p>Finally, we updated the state again. We did this by using the <strong class="source-inline">setPosts</strong> function and passing a merged array consisting of the new posts and the current <strong class="source-inline">posts</strong> array with a destructuring assignment. After that, we cleared <strong class="source-inline">textarea</strong> by passing an empty string to the <strong class="source-inline">setPostContent</strong> function.</p>
			<p>Now, go ahead and play with your working React form. Do not forget that all the posts you create do not persist since they are only held in the local memory of the browser and are not saved to a database. Consequently, refreshing deletes your posts.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Controlling document heads with React Helmet</h2>
			<p>When developing a web application, you must control your document heads. You might want to change the title or description, based on the content you are presenting.</p>
			<p>React Helmet is <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>a great package that offers this on the fly, including<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> overriding multiple headers and server-side rendering. Let's see how we can do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Install React Helmet with the following command:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">npm install --save react-helmet</strong></p><p>You can add all standard HTML headers with React Helmet.</p><p>I recommend keeping standard <strong class="source-inline">head</strong> tags inside your template. This has the advantage that, before React has been rendered, there is always the default document head. For our case, you can directly apply a title and description in <strong class="source-inline">App.js</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>Import <strong class="source-inline">react-helmet</strong> at the top of the file:<p class="source-code">import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';</p></li>
				<li>Add <strong class="source-inline">Helmet</strong> directly above <strong class="source-inline">postForm div</strong>:<p class="source-code">&lt;Helmet&gt;</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;title&gt;Graphbook - Feed&lt;/title&gt;</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;meta name="description" content="Newsfeed of all</p><p class="source-code">    your friends on Graphbook" /&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;/Helmet&gt;</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you reload the browser and watch the title on the tab bar of your browser carefully, you will see that it changes from <strong class="source-inline">Graphbook</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">Graphbook - Feed</strong>. This behavior happens because we already defined a title inside <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong>. When React finishes rendering, the new document head is applied.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Production build with webpack</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker066"/> last step for our React setup is to have a production build. Until now, we were only using <strong class="source-inline">webpack-dev-server</strong>, but this naturally includes an unoptimized development build. Furthermore, webpack automatically spawns a web server. In the next chapter, we will introduce Express.js as our web server so that we don't need webpack to start it.</p>
			<p>A production bundle does merge all JavaScript files, but it also merges all the CSS files into two separate files. Those can be used directly in the browser. To bundle CSS files, we will rely on another webpack plugin, called <strong class="source-inline">MiniCss</strong>:</p>
			<p class="source-code">npm install --save-dev mini-css-extract-plugin</p>
			<p>We do not want to change the current <strong class="source-inline">webpack.client.config.js</strong> file because it is made for development work. Add the following command to the <strong class="source-inline">scripts</strong> object of your <strong class="source-inline">package.json</strong>:</p>
			<p class="source-code">"client:build": "webpack --config webpack.client.build.config.js"</p>
			<p>This command runs webpack using an individual production webpack config file. Let's create this one. First, clone the original <strong class="source-inline">webpack.client.config.js</strong> file and rename it <strong class="source-inline">webpack.client.build.config.js</strong>.</p>
			<p>Change the following things in the new file:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="source-inline">mode</strong> needs to be <strong class="source-inline">production</strong>, not <strong class="source-inline">development</strong>.</li>
				<li>Require the <strong class="source-inline">MiniCss</strong> plugin:<p class="source-code">const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');</p></li>
				<li>Replace the current CSS rule:<p class="source-code">{</p><p class="source-code">  test: /\.css$/,</p><p class="source-code">  use: [{ loader: MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,</p><p class="source-code">    options: {</p><p class="source-code">      publicPath: '../'</p><p class="source-code">    }</p><p class="source-code"> }, 'css-loader'],</p><p class="source-code">},</p><p>We are no longer using <strong class="source-inline">style-loader</strong>; instead, we're using the <strong class="source-inline">MiniCss</strong> plugin. The plugin goes through the complete CSS code, merges it into a separate file, and removes the <strong class="source-inline">import</strong> statements from the <strong class="source-inline">bundle.js</strong> file, which we generate in parallel.</p></li>
				<li>Lastly, add <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>the plugin to the plugins at the bottom of the configuration file:<p class="source-code">new MiniCssExtractPlugin({</p><p class="source-code">  filename: 'bundle.css',</p><p class="source-code">})</p></li>
				<li>Remove the entire <strong class="source-inline">devServer</strong> property.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When you run the new configuration, it won't spawn a server or browser window; it will only create a production JavaScript and CSS bundle and will require them in our <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> file. According to our <strong class="source-inline">webpack.client.build.config.js</strong> file, those three files are going to be saved to the <strong class="source-inline">dist/client</strong> folder.</p>
			<p>You can run this command by executing <strong class="source-inline">npm run client:build</strong>.</p>
			<p>If you look in the <strong class="source-inline">dist/client</strong> folder, you will see three files. You can open the <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> file in your browser. Sadly, the images are broken because the image URLs are not correct anymore. We must accept this for the moment because it will be automatically fixed when we have a working backend.</p>
			<p>With that, we have finished the basic setup for React.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Useful development tools</h1>
			<p>When you're working with React, you want to know why your application rendered the way that it did. You need to know which properties your components received and how their current state looks. Since this is not displayed in the DOM or anywhere else in<a id="_idIndexMarker068"/> Chrome DevTools, you need a separate plugin.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, Facebook has got you covered. Visit <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi</a> and install React Developer Tools. This plugin allows you to inspect <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>React applications and components.

			<p>You will only be able to see those tabs if you are running a React application in development mode. If a React application is running or bundled in production, those extensions won't work.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you are unable to see this tab, you may need to restart Chrome completely. You can also find React Developer Tools for Firefox.</p>
			<p>The first tab allows you to view, search, and edit all the components<a id="_idIndexMarker070"/> of your ReactDOM.</p>
			<p>The left-hand side panel looks much like the regular DOM tree (Elements) in Chrome DevTools, but instead of showing<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> HTML markup, you will see all the components you used inside a tree. ReactDOM rendered this tree into real HTML, as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer011" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_1.6_B17337.jpg" alt="Figure 1.6 – React component tree &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.6 – React component tree </p>
			<p>The first <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>component in the current version of Graphbook should be <strong class="source-inline">&lt;App /&gt;</strong>.</p>
			<p>By clicking a component, your right-hand side panel will show its properties, state, and context. You can try this with the <strong class="source-inline">App</strong> component, which is the only real React component:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer012" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_1.7_B17337.jpg" alt="Figure 1.7 – React component state &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.7 – React component state </p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">App</strong> function is <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>the first component of our application. This is the reason why it received no props. Children can receive properties from their parents; with no parent, there are no props.</p>
			<p>Now, test the <strong class="source-inline">App</strong> function and play around with the state. You will see that changing it rerenders your ReactDOM and updates the HTML. You can edit the <strong class="source-inline">postContent</strong> variable, which inserts the new text inside <strong class="source-inline">textarea</strong>. As you will see, all the events are thrown, and your handler runs. Updating the state always triggers a rerender, so try to update the state as little as possible to use as few computing resources as possible.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we set up a working React environment. This is a good starting point for our frontend as we can write and build static web pages with this setup.</p>
			<p>The next chapter will primarily focus on our setup for the backend. We will configure Express.js to accept our first requests and pass all GraphQL queries to Apollo. Furthermore, you will learn how to use Postman to test your API.</p>
