    deploy it for the world to see! We will delve into the different types of builds
    that Gatsby creates and gain an understanding of how to debug common build errors.
    Following this, we will continue to learn how we can deploy them using a variety
    of different platforms. Additionally, we will discover how we can lock down access
    to our site by serving it up as part of an Express server.

- en: When running `gatsby build`, Gatsby will inspect your site's content, and if
    possible, create a static build. However, if your site contains pages that are
    server-side rendered or have been created via deferred static generation, it will
    create a build that requires server-side code that runs on a Node.js server or
    via serverless functions. Builds of both types can be tested locally using the
    `gatsby serve` command.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common error that you'll come across is `window` and `document` variables
    found in the browser. Therefore, while your site is being built, it is unable
    to access them. You can get around this issue in a couple of ways. You can perform
    a check to confirm that the variable is defined (for example, `typeof window !==
    undefined && yourFunction()`), or if appropriate, you can move the code into a
    `useEffect` hook.
  prefs:

    to builds crashing out.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take special care to ensure that all JavaScript files found within your `pages`
    directory are React components with a default export. Gatsby treats all JavaScript
    files as pages within this folder. If you have components or other utility functions
    within this directory, you will get an error that says **A page component must
    export a React component for it to be valid**. If you see this error, just move
    the files in question outside of the folder.

    in this list that does not require you to push your code to a VCS. If you have
    a project where you do not wish to use a VCS, this is a great choice. It's important
    to note that, unlike the other platforms, Firebase will not automatically deploy
    your project unless it has been set up as part of a deployment pipeline.

    previous sections, you should be able to send a friend the site URL, and they
    should be able to see it. However, what if you don't want your site to be visible
    to everyone but only a selected few? Next, let's look at how we can reduce the
    level of access to our site for when the situation requires it.

    your site. One word – security. In all the examples we have seen so far, our site
    is public and out there on the internet for all to see, but what if you are building
    an application that is only for a selected group of people? Perhaps it's portfolio
    work that you want to have locked behind a password or an onboarding application
    that should only be available to colleagues at a specific company. We can achieve
    functionalities such as these using most backend web applications.

    have assumed that the Gatsby project is being hosted on its own dedicated server,
    but sometimes, you don't always have the luxury of multiple servers. This example
    is also a great demonstration of how you can combine backend and frontend code
    on a single server. You could use a similar approach to lock down your site to
    certain IP ranges. For instance, we could expand upon this Express server to serve
    API endpoints alongside our Gatsby project within the same repository.

    and the differences between them. We looked at common errors that crop up during
    build time and how we can debug them. We learned how we can deploy hybrid builds
    using Gatsby Cloud and how we can deploy static builds with Netlify, Render, and
    Firebase. Additionally, we discovered how we can lock down access to our site
    by serving it up as part of an Express server. You should now feel comfortable
    with the process of taking your site live.
