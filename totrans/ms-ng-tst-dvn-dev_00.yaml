    <st c="49">(</st>**<st c="51">TDD</st>**<st c="54">) is a software development
    process widely used in Angular development to ensure code quality and reduce the
    time spent debugging.</st> <st c="186">TDD is an agile approach to software development
    that emphasizes the iterative writing of tests before writing the actual code.</st>
    <st c="314">The TDD process comprises</st> <st c="340">three steps:</st>
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '<st c="352">Red: In this initial phase, developers write a test for the functionality
    they aim to implement.</st> <st c="450">Since there is no corresponding code yet,
    this test will initially fail, hence the term “Red” to indicate the failing state
    of the test.</st>'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '<st c="586">Green: Following the Red phase, developers write the minimum amount
    of code necessary to make the test pass.</st> <st c="696">This phase aims to quickly
    move from a failing test (Red) to a passing test (Green), focusing on satisfying
    the test’s conditions without necessarily optimizing the code.</st>'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '<st c="866">Refactor: After successfully passing the test, the code is then
    improved and optimized.</st> <st c="955">This phase involves refining the code’s
    design, structure, and efficiency while ensuring that the test remains green,
    i.e., continues to pass.</st> <st c="1098">Refactoring is crucial for enhancing
    code quality, maintainability, and performance without altering the external behavior
    of the code, as confirmed by the passing tests.</st>'

    ensuring that every part of the software is thoroughly tested and backed by tests,
    thereby promoting high code quality, reducing bugs, and facilitating</st> <st
    c="1485">confident refactoring.</st>

    the essential resources to improve their skills and deliver high-quality Angular
    applications.</st> <st c="1668">With a hands-on approach and real-world examples,
    it covers TDD concepts, techniques, and tools extensively, going beyond unit testing
    to explore Agular’s pipe, form, and reactive programming testing.</st> <st c="1869">In
    this book, you’ll learn how to validate and manipulate data using pipes, test
    Angular forms for input validation and user interaction, and handle asynchronous
    operations with reactive programming.</st> <st c="2069">In addition, you’ll explore
    end-to-end testing using the Protractor, Cypress, and Playwright frameworks, gaining
    valuable insights into writing robust tests for web applications, covering navigation,
    element interaction, and behavior validation.</st> <st c="2315">You’ll also explore
    the integration of TDD with CI/CD, learning best practices for automating tests,
