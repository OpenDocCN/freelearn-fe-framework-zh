<p>NgRx is an implementation of the popular pattern, Redux, that's meant for use with Angular. It is entirely possible to create an Angular application without NgRx. You might even be very successful in doing so. There are situations, though, where Redux can really help; you can get that help by using NgRx.</p>
<p>So, what is Redux and when do we need it? Redux is about adding predictability to your app. Predictability is about knowing who did what to the state in your application.</p>
<p>Single source of truth is a concept that Redux lives up to as it promotes adding all your data to one store. At any given moment, you will be able to tell what state your application is in. This is great if you want to save the state and come back to it (also called rehydration) like you would in a game where you create a save point and later resume your game from that save point.</p>
<p>It's not only about having a single source of truth; it's also about knowing who is allowed to change the content, or the state, of the store. A challenge you often face is that as an application grows, you need to add a lot of views and controllers, you gradually lose the overview of what code affects what state in the application. Redux helps you with this by ensuring that a view can't change the state directly but will have to dispatch actions that represent the intent of how you want the state to change.</p>
<p>Another thing that might happen is that a lot of user interaction kicks off a lot of changes to the state. Some of those actions should lead to immediate changes and some lead to asynchronous actions that will eventually change the state of the application. The important thing at this point is that we ensure that all those changes happen in the right order. Redux helps us with that by queuing up all the actions and ensures that our app changes its state in a predictable way.</p>
<p>A very important aspect of Redux is that when it changes the state, it does not mutate it. It replaces the state with a copy of the old state, but with the latest action applied to it. If we take our game analogy again, imagine that you have a game and you want to add a potion to your backpack. When you do that in Redux, we replace the main character; we replace it with a main character that has a potion in its backpack. The fact that we do things this way makes it easy for us to remember each previous state and return to an earlier state if we need to, which is known as time-travel-debugging. To enable us to replace the previous state with a new state, we are using something called pure functions. Pure functions ensure that we only create a copy of the data instead of mutating it.</p>
<p>There are a lot of benefits to knowing what state your app contains at a given point. However, not all the state in your app will need Redux. It comes down to preference. Some prefer to put all the state in the store, some prefer to put some state in the store, and some other state is fine if it only lives as local state in a specific component. Think of it this way, if you were to restore your app, what state would be okay to lose; the answer may be a drop-down selection made or something else, if anything. Having everything in the store will ensure that you don't, by mistake, make extra Ajax calls if the store already holds the data, so it is a way of helping you with caching as well.</p>

<p>This book is intended for Angular developers who have written an app or two and are looking for a more structured way to handle data management. This means you ideally have a decent grasp of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and know how to scaffold an Angular application using angular-cli, and you also know how to make AJAX requests using the HttpClient service in Angular.</p>

<p><a href="6a4e361c-0567-4d80-b889-2643e199c96a.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Quick Look Back at Data Services for Simple Apps</em><span>, covers how to work with services and how Angular dependency injection helps out. It also brings up the MVC pattern and  discusses cohesion and coupling.</span></p>
<p><a href="81d377c1-aafe-4eff-a7cd-a1b64629454c.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>1.21 Gigawatt – Flux Pattern Explained</em><span>, teaches what the Flux pattern is and what concepts it consists of. It shows how to implement the Flux pattern using stores, a dispatcher, and several views.</span></p>
<p><a href="fb400b4b-5f47-4df8-96e8-ec0032370c66.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Asynchronous Programming</em><span>, looks at what asynchronous means and talks about callbacks, promises, async/await, and how the async library can help us create order in our asynchronous code.</span></p>
<p><a href="8b39d931-ad22-4fea-8856-ab22c8cb077a.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Functional Reactive Programming</em><span>, compares declarative and imperative programming and looks at a subset of declarative programming, functional programming. We drill down into certain properties of functional programming, such as higher-order functions, immutability, and recursion. Furthermore, we look at how to make code reactive and what reactive means.</span></p>
<p><a href="84bb33e0-d186-4abe-9b3f-10ba1ae911c8.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>RxJS Basics</em><span>, introduces the RxJS library. Furthermore, it brings up concepts such as Observable, Producer, and Observer. It further discusses how the Observable is the asynchronous concept that we need to unify all our asynchronous concepts into one. We also touch on operators and what they are. Lastly, we attempt to build our own micro implementation of RxJS to further understand what's going on under the hood.</span></p>
<p><a href="887ffe0b-5c42-47b8-9fd7-9e13e4a8d0a4.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Manipulating Stream and Their Values</em><span>, focuses a lot on educating the reader on operators, the thing that gives RxJS its power. The reader should leave this chapter with a lot more knowledge about how to manipulate data as well as Observables.</span></p>
<p><a href="f9ddd481-07d2-4008-a72d-384454489d5b.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>RxJS Advanced</em><span>, goes deeper and tries to explain more advanced concepts in RxJS, such as hot and cold Observables, subjects, error handling, and how to test your RxJS code with Marble testing.</span></p>
<p><a href="e29180be-1bdf-4fdb-805b-333607fd6e0d.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Redux</em><span>, demonstrates the Redux pattern and explains how it came from the Flux pattern and improved upon some of its paradigms and concepts. The reader will learn how it works in practice by learning to build their own Redux and also using the same, involving a couple of views.</span></p>
<p><a href="f57e66b8-c58d-4735-90fb-0d0e9638e8a5.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>NgRx – Reduxing that Angular App</em><span>, explores what NgRx is and what it consists of. It also shows the reader how to put it in to use by adding it to an Angular application. Concepts such as store are explained and demoed, and the reader will learn how to debug and handle side effects with the Effects library.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="3b2b35d3-b023-468d-814d-d76907110933.xhtml">Chapter 10</a><em>, NgRx – In Depth</em>, covers the Entity library, which allows you to write way less code by reducing a lot of boilerplate. It also shows how you can put a router's state in the store. Furthermore, we look at how to test NgRx, how to build it yourself, and lastly, we cover Schematics, which will help us further by allowing us to scaffold the most common constructs we need to work with in NgRx.</span></p>

<p>This book is about building Angular applications using NGRX. To get the most out of the book you need a basic understanding of the Angular framework and should be able to scaffold an Angular application using the Angular-CLI or be able to set up an Angular project through Webpack, if that is your preferred way. It's good to have a decent understanding of JavaScript and TypeScript. Most of all a curious mind is really all you need. It's a good idea to have NodeJs installed on your machine.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>We ne</span><span>ed to install </span><kbd>webpack</kbd><span> by typing the following in our terminal.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>interface IPrinter {<br/>  print(IPrintable printable);<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre><strong>interface IPrintable {</strong><br/><strong>  String getContent();</strong><br/><strong>}</strong><br/><br/>interface IPrinter {<br/>  print(IPrintable printable);<br/>}</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Let's add an item to our store by adding a value to our input element and pressing the <span class="packt_screen">Save</span> button.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
