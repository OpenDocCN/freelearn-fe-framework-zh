- en: The increase in web developers relying on JavaScript to build their frontends
    and backends has been huge in the last few years. This book covers some of the
    major technologies from Apollo, Express.js, Node.js, and React. We will go through
    how to set up React and Apollo to run GraphQL requests against your backend built
    with Node.js and Sequelize. On top of that, we will introduce testing for the
    components or functions we have written and automate the deployment on AWS ECS
    with CircleCI. By the end of the book, you will know how to combine the newest
    frontend and backend technologies.

- en: This book is for web developers familiar with React and GraphQL who want to
    enhance their skills and build full-stack applications using industry standards
    such as React, Apollo, Node.js, and SQL at scale while learning to solve complex
    problems with GraphQL.

    Your Development Environment*, explains the architecture of an application by
    going through some core concepts, the complete process, and preparing a working
    React setup. We will see how React, Apollo Client, and Express.js fit together
    and cover some good practices when working with React. Further, we will show you
    how to debug the frontend with React Developer Tools.'

    GraphQL with Express.js*, teaches you how to configure your backend by installing
    Express.js and Apollo via NPM. Express.js will be used for the web server, which
    handles and passes all GraphQL requests to Apollo.'

    to the Database*, discusses the opportunities that GraphQL offers when it comes
    to mutating and querying data. As an example, we will use traditional SQL to build
    a full application. To simplify the database code, we will use Sequelize, which
    lets us query our SQL Server with a normal JavaScript object and also allows us
    to use MySQL, MSSQL, PostgresSQL, or just a SQLite file. We will build models
    and schemas for users and posts in Apollo and Sequelize.'

    components to send GraphQL requests. This chapter will explain Apollo-specific
    configurations.'

    workflow by using best practices.'

    system built on top of Apollo. Moving on, to go beyond normal requests with JSON
    responses as with GraphQL, we will now upload images via Apollo and save them
    in separate object storage such as AWS S3.'

    your end user. This chapter will focus on getting your current application moved

    notification bar. This chapter will focus on how to build this feature with a
    more or less experimental GraphQL and Apollo feature called subscriptions.'

    has an automated testing environment. We will use Mocha, a JavaScript unit testing
    framework, and Enzyme, a React testing tool, to ensure the quality of our application.
    This chapter will focus on testing the GraphQL backend and how to properly test
    React applications with Enzyme.'

    Deployment with CircleCI and AWS*, studies deployment. Deploying an application
    means no more uploading files manually via FTP. Nowadays, you can virtually run
    your application in the cloud without having a complete server running. For easy
    deployment of our application, we will use Docker. Before deploying our application,
    we will quickly cover a basic continuous deployment setup, which will let you
    deploy all your new code with ease. This chapter will explain how to deploy your
    applications using Git, Docker, AWS, and CircleCI.'
