- en: NativeScript is an open source framework built by Progress to build truly native
    mobile apps with Angular, TypeScript, or even good old plain JavaScript. Angular
    is also an open source framework built by Google that offers declarative templates,
    dependency injection, and rich modules to build applications. Angular's versatile
    view handling architecture allows your views to be rendered as real native UI
    components--native to iOS or Android--that offer superior performance with fluid
    usability. This decoupling of the view rendering layer in Angular, combined with
    the power of native APIs in NativeScript, has come together to create the powerful
    combination that is the exciting world of NativeScript for Angular.

- en: This book focuses on the key concepts you need to know to build NativeScript
    for your Angular mobile app on iOS and Android. We'll build a fun multitrack recording
    studio app, touching on the powerful native key concepts you need to know when
    you start building an app of your own. Having the right structure is critical
    to developing an app that can scale while also being highly maintainable and portable,
    so we'll start with project organization using Angular's @NgModule. We'll use
    Angular Components to build our first view and then create services that we can
    use via Angular's dependency injection.

- en: You'll understand NativeScript's tns command-line utility to run the app on
    iOS and Android. We'll integrate third-party plugins to construct some of the
    core features. Next, we'll integrate the @ngrx store plus effects to establish
    some solid practices (Redux inspired) to deal with state management. Having a
    great data flow and solid architecture is meaningless if the app doesn't look
    good or offer a great user experience, so we'll use SASS to polish a style for
    our app. After that, we'll deal with debugging problems and invest some time into
    writing tests to prevent bugs in the future. Lastly, we'll bundle our app with
    webpack and deploy it to the Apple App Store and Google Play.

    Shape with @NgModule*, discusses the @NgModule decorator, which clearly defines
    a segment of functionality in your app . This will be the organizational unit
    of your project. Before you begin building your app, you will gain many benefits
    by taking a moment and thinking about the various units/sections/modules that
    you may need/want for your app.'

    that will need to set up routing. Angular provides a powerful router that, when
    combined with NativeScript, works hand in hand with the native mobile page navigation
    system on iOS and Android. Additionally, we will set up the lazy loading of various
    routes to ensure that our app''s launch time remains as speedy as possible.'
