- en: State management is one of the hottest topics in the React ecosystem. There
    are many libraries and tools for handling state in React, and with each comes
    different recipes and opinions. One thing is clear – state management solutions
    for handling client state are not so good at dealing with server state. React
    Query was created as a solution to help manage your server state!

- en: In *State Management with React Query*, you will get a guide that will take
    you from zero to hero with React Query by the end of the book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll begin by learning the historical background of state in the React world
    and what led to the need to change from global state to client and server state.
    With this knowledge under your belt, you will understand the need for React Query.
    As you advance through the chapters, you’ll learn how React Query helps you to
    deal with common server state challenges, such as fetching data, caching data,
    updating data, and synchronizing your data with the server.

- en: But this is not all – once you have mastered React Query, you will learn how
    to apply this knowledge to server-side rendering.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, you will learn some patterns for testing your code by leveraging the
    Testing Library and Mock Service Worker.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the end of this book, you’ll have a new perspective on state and be able
    to leverage React Query to solve all the challenges of server state in your applications.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: State is what makes your applications move. What many of us are not often aware
    of is that there are different types of state. These different types lead to different
    challenges when managing the given state. In this part, we will understand more
    about state and how we manage it. During this process, we will understand that
    the server and client states have very different challenges that need to be handled
    separately and with different tools. To deal with server state, we will learn
    more about the TanStack Query React adapter called React Query and see how to
    add it to our applications.
