- en: React was built by Meta to provide more structure to its code base and allow
    it to scale much better. React worked so well for Facebook that they eventually
    made it open source. Today, React is the dominant technology for building the
    frontend of an application; it allows us to build small, isolated, and highly
    reusable components that can be composed together to create complex frontends.

- en: TypeScript was built by Microsoft to help developers more easily develop large
    JavaScript-based programs. It is a superset of JavaScript that brings a rich type
    system to it. This type system helps developers to catch bugs early and allows
    tools to be created to robustly navigate and refactor code.

    sophisticated frontends that are easy to maintain.

- en: If you are a developer who wants to create large and complex frontends with
    React and TypeScript, this book is for you. The book doesn’t assume you have any
    previous knowledge of React or TypeScript – however, basic knowledge of JavaScript,
    HTML, and CSS will help you get to grips with the concepts covered.
