			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">Throughout this book, you have heard how amazing the Vue.js community is and seen first-hand the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker770"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">great work that the core team and the package maintainers do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.2">The Vue.js framework is well documented and well maintained, the development experience is well defined, and the same applies to core-maintained packages such as vue-router and Pinia, but also external ones such as VeeValidate and many more within </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">the ecosystem.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">This level of consistency does not come for free, and there is a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes to ensure that the community feels accepted and supported. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.2">This work is at times done by developers who, due to the nature of open source, do not earn a wage for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">their contribution.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">After reading this book, you have become an integrated part of the Vue.js community, and you should try your best to contribute back to the community and help maintain it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.2">Doing so will </span><a id="_idIndexMarker771"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">not only support the ecosystem and future developers, but it will also help </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">you grow.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">Let’s see the different ways in which a community member can get involved in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">the community:</span></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="old"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">Documentation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1">: If you are not new to open source, you have probably heard people asking for help with documentation many times before. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.2">This is mainly because it is truly the most important and easier action that can be taken by developer to contribute back to the open source community. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.3">As a new member of the Vue.js community and first-time user of the technology, you will be able to assess what documentation is well written and what may need to be improved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.4">All Vue.js documentation is open source, so if you find something that needs fixing, create </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">a PR.</span></span></li>
				<li><strong class="old"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.1">Reproduce bug report</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.1">: When I first started to learn Vue.js, this was one of the main sources of learning material for me. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.2">In fact, there are plenty of bugs that are raised within the core framework and its libraries, and quite a few that are not accompanied by reproducible code or have an incorrect reproduction. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.3">Trying to reproduce a bug that has been shared is a very good way to learn more about Vue.js. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.4">These issues can be found in the main repositories with the label </span><strong class="old"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1">need </span></strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="old"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">repro</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1"> (</span></span><a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue/labels/need%20repro"><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">https://github.com/vuejs/vue/labels/need%20repro</span></span></a><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">).</span></span></li>
				<li><strong class="old"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">Host meetups</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">: There is no better way to help Vue.js grow than by hosting a local meetup. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.2">Hosting a meetup may not be for everyone, but if you have the right personality and interest, it can be extremely rewarding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.3">You will not only gain popularity within the industry, but you will also learn a ton as you will meet other people within the Vue community and also hear about them during </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">your events.</span></span></li>
				<li><strong class="old"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">Be an active Discord member</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1">: In the first section of this chapter, we mentioned Discord as a way to keep yourself informed within the community. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.2">In this section, we mention Discord again as a way for you to contribute to the community. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.3">You may not be able to help straight away, but as you gain some knowledge, you should try and help triage some of the questions and discussions shared in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">the chat.</span></span></li>
				<li><strong class="old"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">Donate</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1">: If you are starting your development career now, this may not be something that you can afford, but as you grow into your career you should consider it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.2">Vue.js does not have a huge company backing it, and most of the core maintainers’ wages are made up of small donations made by people like me and you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.3">Every small </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1">donation helps.</span></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">No matter </span><a id="_idIndexMarker772"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1">how you do it, what matters the most is that you try to give back to this amazing community and become an active part of it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.2">In the next and last section of this chapter and book, we are going to summarize what we have achieved within the course of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1">this book.</span></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor200"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1">Let’s look back at what we’ve achieved</span></h1>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1">You have reached the very end of this book, and you are ready to go and experience Vue.js on your own. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.2">When learning new technologies, like you did in this book, it does not come easy, and it is possible that you will need to go back and revisit some of the topics that we covered during the course of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">the book.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">In this section, we are going to have a quick recap of what we have learned and what we can accomplish with it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.2">Going over a topic multiple times will not only help you memorize it, but it will also support you in understanding its meaning and therefore allow you to apply it to different </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">use cases.</span></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">All about Vue.js</span></h2>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">We started the book by learning about Vue.js and, most importantly, about its reactivity system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.2">Across different frameworks, Vue.js’ reactivity is very powerful, and understanding it is a must if you want to improve </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">your skills.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">Next, we learned about Vue.js lifecycles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.2">The framework works on a well-defined cycle, and learning about it is essential to enable you to create </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">performant applications.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">Finally, we completed the section about Vue.js by learning the structure of a Vue.js component </span><a id="_idIndexMarker773"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">also known as a </span><strong class="old"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">Single File Component</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1"> (</span><strong class="old"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">SFC</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.2">We learned about its composition and used it extensively in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">the book.</span></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor202"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">From the basics and beyond</span></h2>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">With the help of our Companion App, we have learned how to turn static HTML into a dynamic Vue.js component. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.2">We learned the basics of the framework by introducing string interpolation, Refs, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">and R</span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1">eactive</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">We then continued to increase the complexity of our application by introducing some of the Vue.js built-in directives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.2">With features such as </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">v-if</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1"> and </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">v-for</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1">, we were able to increase the amount of functionality offered by our components, still</span><a id="_idTextAnchor203"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1"> being able to write </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">elegant components.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1">Last, we introduced </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">computed </span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">and </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">methods</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.2">These gave us the ability to add logic to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">our components.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">With the knowledge learned so far, we could turn a very static website into a dynamic and powerful web application that would outclass simple static </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1">HTML sites.</span></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor204"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.1">From component to components</span></h2>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.1">From </span><a href="B21130_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor074"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.1">Chapter 6</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.1"> onward, we started to expand our learning from a single component to multiple ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.2">We did so by introducing props and events. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.3">This allowed us to create components that could speak and depend on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1">each other.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1">With these extra topics, we also had a chance to re-introduce and use Vue.js lifecycles, which we learned about at the start of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1">the book.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1">To finish it off, we started to connect all the different topics we’d covered up to this stage by loading data asynchronously. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.2">To do so, we had to use methods, lifecycles, events, Refs, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">and props.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">At the end of this section, which concluded with </span><a href="B21130_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor088"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">Chapter 7</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">, we concluded the foundation </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.1">of Vue.js.</span></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-196"><a id="_idTextAnchor205"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1">Vue.js ecosystem</span></h2>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1">After the basics of Vue.js, it was time to move on and introduce important topics such as tests, routers, and state management and move away from the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">core framework.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1">In the chapters that followed the basic topics, we first learned how to write unit and E2E tests in our applications with Cypress </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">and Vitest.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1">Next, we introduced two libraries maintained by the Vue core team members: Pinia and vue-router. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.2">With Pinia, we introduced the notion of state management and refactored our Companion App to use Pinia to support its state, while vue-router was used to implement a routing system and transform our single application into a complex application with multiple pages and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">nested routes.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">After routes and state, it was time to add some user interactivity by learning how to manage forms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.2">We did so by introducing the notion of two-way binding with V-Model and then discussed how using an external library such as VeeValidate could help us develop complex and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1">well-structured forms.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1">Last, we stepped away from coding and learned how to use the Vue.js devtools extension to help us develop and debug our </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.1">Vue.js applications.</span></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-197"><a id="_idTextAnchor206"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.1">Just the tip of the iceberg</span></h2>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.1">Along with the books, we have discussed possible exercises and learning that you could undertake to improve your understanding of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.1">various topics.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.1">The information shared within the book and the exercises provided were just the tip of the iceberg. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.2">To fully understand how Vue.js works and be prolific with it, you will have to continue to practice and use what you have learned in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">this book.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1">What I suggest you do is keep practicing, maybe by setting specific daily involvement goals or by joining communities such as #100daysofcode. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.2">You can practice by creating very small proofs of concept using Vue.js Playground to test your knowledge or replicate a small part of existing applications with all their knowledge and interactivity to push your understanding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.3">After you feel like you have gained enough understanding of the foundations of Vue.js and its ecosystem, it would be a good idea to try and clone an existing web application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.4">This is an extremely useful practice that can help you focus on the practical part of learning Vue.js without the need to come up with an app idea from scratch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.5">A few examples of applications that could be replicated are social media platforms, news platforms, and weather apps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.6">They provide a good level of interactivity and offer free APIs </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1">and resources.</span></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-198"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.1">Summary</span></h1>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1">After 14 chapters aimed at improving your skills as a Vue.js developer, we have finally reached the end of this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.2">Completing this book is probably associated with the beginning of your career </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.1">in Vue.js.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1">What you have learned in this book should be enough to start your career, but it is not going to be enough on its own. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.2">What is left for you now is true dedication and consistency in trying to apply everything you have learned here to a real-world project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.3">As you do so, you may find yourself going back and revisiting a chapter or section or reading further to deepen your knowledge (always start your research with the Vue.js </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1">official documentation).</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1">Vue.js is a fantastic framework, and I can assure you that you have made a good choice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.2">As we mentioned time and time again, what makes Vue.js unique is not just its code and features, but the full ecosystem and community built </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">around it.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">Finding a good way to engage with the community will help you stay motivated and engaged, but, most importantly, interacting with other Vue.js developers can help you overcome issues and obstacles that you will face throughout </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1">your career.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">All Vue.js core libraries and its ecosystem are built on top of the framework’s core logic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.2">This not only makes things familiar as you move between libraries, but it also means that mastering the framework’s core foundation will help you understand the whole ecosystem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.3">I have had the pleasure of meeting many Vue.js developers, and the trait that made the most senior developers stand out was their understanding of Vue.js to its core. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.4">This does not need you to learn the actual code base, but just try to really focus and understand the topics covered in the first two chapters, such as </span><strong class="old"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1">reactivity </span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1">and </span><strong class="old"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.1">lifecycles</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.2">Vue.js reactivity will help you understand when things update and why, while the lifecycles will provide an understanding of how the framework re-renders and the flow that it follows when doing so. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.3">I usually like to compare development to a dance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.4">There are different steps, and you may not know them all at the very start, but what matters the most is that you know how to listen to music and move with it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.5">The rest will come as you keep practicing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.6">Learning the foundation of Vue.js is the same as being able to listen to music, and knowing it well will make the rest of your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.1">journey easier.</span></span></p>
			<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1">At this stage, I can just wish you all the best in your future and hope that Vue.js turns out to be a good choice for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">your career.</span></span></p>
