			<p>Next.js is a scalable and high-performance React.js framework for modern web development. It provides a large set of features, such as hybrid rendering, route prefetching, automatic image optimization, and internationalization, out of the box.</p>
			<p>Next.js is an exciting technology that can be used for many purposes. If you (or your company) want to create an e-commerce platform, a blog, or a simple website, with this book, you can learn how to do it without compromising on performance, user experience, or developer happiness. Starting from the basics of Next.js, you will understand how the framework can help you reach your goals, and you will realize how versatile Next.js is by building real-world applications with step-by-step explanations. You will learn how to choose the proper rendering methodology for your website, how to secure it, and how to deploy it to different providers. We'll always keep a focus on performance and developer happiness.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will be able to design, build, and deploy beautiful and modern architectures using Next.js with any headless CMS or data source. </p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Conventions used</h1>
			<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Code in text</strong>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "We're going to use Next.js' built-in <strong class="source-inline">getServerSideProps</strong> function to dynamically get the <strong class="source-inline">[name]</strong> variable from the URL and greet the user."</p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">export async function getServerSideProps({ params }) {  const { name } = params;  return {    props: {      name     }  } }function Greet(props) {  return (    &lt;h1&gt; Hello, {props.name}! &lt;/h1&gt;  )}export default Greet;</p>
			<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;Link <strong class="bold">href='/blog/2021-01-01/happy-new-year'</strong>&gt;  Read post &lt;/Link&gt;&lt;Link <strong class="bold">href='/blog/2021-03-05/match-update'</strong>&gt;  Read post &lt;/Link&gt;&lt;Link <strong class="bold">href='/blog/2021-04-23/i-love-nextjs'</strong>&gt;  Read post &lt;/Link&gt;</p>
			<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">echo "Hello, world!" &gt;&gt; ./public/index.txt</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: "In fact, if we open the Google Chrome developer tools and go to <strong class="bold">Network</strong>, we can select the HTTP request for the endpoint above and see the authorization token in plain text under the <strong class="bold">Request Headers</strong> section."</p>
