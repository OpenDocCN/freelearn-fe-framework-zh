- en: Angular is one of the most popular frameworks in the world for building not
    only web applications but even mobile and desktop applications as well. Backed
    by Google and used by Google, this framework is used by millions of applications.
    Although the framework is well-suited for applications of any scale, enterprises
    particularly favor Angular due to its opinionated nature and its consistent ecosystem,
    which includes all the tools necessary for creating modern & production-ready
    web applications.

- en: While learning the core technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is an
    absolute essential to progress as a web developer, when it comes to a framework,
    learning the core concepts of the framework itself is important too. When we’re
    dealing with Angular, there are a lot of amazing things we can do with our web
    applications by learning about, and using, the right tools in the Angular ecosystem.
    That’s where this book comes in.

- en: This book was written for intermediate and advanced Angular developers to polish
    their Angular development skills with recipes that you can follow easily, play
    around with, and practice your own variations of. You’ll not only learn from the
    recipes themselves but also from the actual real-life projects associated with
    the recipes. So, there are a lot of hidden gems in these recipes and projects
    for you.
