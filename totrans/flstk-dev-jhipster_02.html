<p>JHipster is a development platform that helps you go from zero to hero! JHipster can help you to create beautiful web applications and complex microservice architectures in a jiffy. JHipster also offers various tools to develop the application further using business entities, and deploy it to various cloud services and platforms. At its core, JHipster is a Yeoman generator that creates Spring Boot and Angular/React based applications. It can create monolithic architecture as well as microservice architecture with every feature working out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why use JHipster and how it helps compared to traditional development approaches</li>
<li>What is the goal of JHipster?</li>
<li>The various server-side and client-side technology options available in JHipster</li>
<li><span>Preparation of a development environment</span></li>
<li>Installation of JHipster and required dependencies</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_tip packt_infobox">Yeoman (<a href="http://yeoman.io">http://yeoman.io</a>) is a scaffolding tool that helps you to create code generators. You can use it to create any kind of application generator with the help of the built-in template engine and tools.</div>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Why JHipster?</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>If you are wondering why you should be using JHipster, then just imagine the following scenario. You are tasked to build a web application, let us say a blog with an Angular frontend and a Java backend, with features for users to create blog posts and be able to display blog posts based on user permissions. You are also asked to build administrative modules such as user management, monitoring, and so on. Finally, you have to test and deploy the application to a cloud service.</p>
<p>If you are approaching this challenge the traditional way you will most probably be doing the following steps. Let's skip the details for simplicity. So, the steps would be as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design an architecture stack and decide on various libraries to use (let's say you choose Spring Framework for the backend, with Spring Security and Spring MVC)</li>
<li>Create an application base with all the technologies wired together (for example, you will have to make sure the authentication flow between the Angular client side and Spring Security is wired properly)</li>
<li>Write a build system for the application (let's say you used webpack to build the Angular client side and Gradle to build the server side)</li>
<li>Write integration tests and unit tests for the base</li>
<li>Create administrative modules</li>
<li>Design business entities and create them with the Angular client side and Java server side with test coverage</li>
<li>Write all the business logic, test the application, and deploy it</li>
</ol>
<p>While this approach definitely works, for this simple application you would have spent anywhere between four to six weeks depending on the team size. Now, more than 70% of the effort would have been spent on writing boilerplate code and making sure all the libraries work well together. Now, would you believe me if I say that you could develop, test, and deploy this application in less than 30 minutes using JHipster? Yes, you can, while still getting high-quality production grade code with lots of extra bells and whistles. We will see this in action in our next chapter where we will build a real-world application using JHipster.</p>

<p>The goal of JHipster is to provide developers a platform where you can focus on your business logic rather than worrying about wiring different technologies together, and also that provides a great developer experience. Of course, you can use available boilerplate within your organization or from the internet and try to wire them up together, but then you will be wasting a lot of time re-inventing the wheel. With JHipster, you will create a modern web application or microservice architecture with all the required technologies wired together and working out-of-the-box, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A robust and high-performance Spring Framework-based Java stack on the backend</li>
<li>A rich mobile-first frontend with Angular or React supported by Bootstrap</li>
<li>A battle-tested microservice architecture unifying Netflix OSS, Elastic stack, and Docker</li>
<li>A great tooling and development workflow using Maven/Gradle, webpack, and Yarn/NPM</li>
<li>Out-of-the-box continuous integration using Jenkins, Travis, or GitLab</li>
<li>Excellent Docker support and support for orchestration tools such as Kubernetes, Rancher, and Openshift <span>out-of-the-box</span></li>
<li>Out-of-the-box support for various cloud deployments</li>
<li>Above all, great code with lots of best practices and industry standards at your fingertips</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span class="packt_screen">Netflix OSS</span> (<a href="https://netflix.github.io">https://netflix.github.io</a>) is a collection of open source tools and software produced by the <span>NETFLIX, INC</span> team geared toward microservice architecture. Elastic stack (<a href="https://www.elastic.co/products">https://www.elastic.co/products</a>)<strong> </strong>(formerly known as <span class="packt_screen">ELK stack</span>) is a collection of software tools, which help in monitoring and analytics of microservices developed by the Elasticsearch (<a href="https://www.elastic.co">https://www.elastic.co</a>) team.</div>
<p>JHipster has been steadily increasing in popularity as Spring Boot and Angular gained momentum, and lots of developers have started to adopt them as the de facto frameworks for web development. As per official statistics at the time of writing (beginning of 2018), there are more than 5,000 applications generated per month and JHipster was installed around  1 million times. It has more than 400 contributors with official contributions from Google, RedHat, Heroku, and so on.</p>

<p>JHipster supports an incredible number of modern web application technologies out of the box. Some of them are used as the base or core of the generated application while some technologies are opt-in via choices made during application generation. Let us see the different technologies supported mainly for monolithic applications <span>in brief</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-side technologies</li>
<li>Server-side technologies</li>
<li>Database options</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more technologies supported and we will look at them in later chapters when we touch upon microservices.</p>

<p>The role of client-side technologies in full-stack development has grown from just using JavaScript for client-side validations, to writing full-blown, single page applications using client-side MVVM frameworks. The frameworks and toolchains used have become complex and overwhelming for developers who are new to the client-side landscape. Fortunately for us, JHipster provides support for most of the following, widely used, client-side technologies. Let us take a brief look and get familiar with the important tools and technologies that we will use. No need to worry if it is overwhelming, we will take a deeper look at some of the more important ones during the course of the book.</p>

<p>CSS3 (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3</a>) is the latest of the <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong><span> </span><span>(</span><span>CSS</span><span>) specification. It adds support for media query, animations, flexbox, round corners, and a lot more. CSS3 makes it possible to natively animate elements, apply special effects, apply filters, and so on to get rid of the many JavaScript hacks that were used earlier.</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span class="packt_screen">Flexible Box</span><span class="seoSummary">, or<span> </span></span>flexbox, <span class="seoSummary">is a<span> </span>layout mode (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_mode">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_mode</a>)<span> that can be used instead of the box model used traditionally.

<p><strong>Syntactically awesome style sheets</strong> (<strong>Sass</strong>) (<a href="http://sass-lang.com">http://sass-lang.com</a>) is a CSS extension language. It is preprocessed and converted to CSS during compile time. It has similar semantics to CSS and is 100% compatible with all versions of CSS. It additionally supports advanced features such as nested syntax, <span>variables, mixins, inheritance, partials, and so on. Sass makes it possible to reuse CSS and to write maintainable style sheets.</span></p>

<p>Bootstrap (<a href="https://getbootstrap.com">https://getbootstrap.com</a>) is a responsive UI framework for modern web development. It offers a mobile-first approach for web development with utilities and UI components that are fully responsive. Bootstrap 4 is the latest version, uses flexbox for layout, and is completely written in Sass, which makes it easier to customize. Bootstrap supports a 12-column grid framework, which lets you build responsive web pages with ease. JHipster uses ng-bootstrap (<a href="https://ng-bootstrap.github.io">https://ng-bootstrap.github.io</a>) so that pure Angular components are used instead of the ones provided by Bootstrap, which are built using JQuery, and Bootstrap is used only for styling.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span class="packt_screen">Mobile first web development</span> is an approach where the UX/UI is designed for smaller screen sizes first thus forcing you to focus on the most important data/elements to be presented. This design is then gradually enhanced for bigger screen sizes making the end result responsive and efficient.</div>

<p><span><strong>Model-View-View-Model</strong></span> (<span><strong>MVVM</strong></span>)<span> is an architectural pattern originally developed by Microsoft. It helps to abstract or separate the client side (GUI) development from the server side (data model). The view model is an abstraction of the View and represents the state of data in the Model. With JHipster</span>, <span>you can choose between Angular and React as the client-side framework.</span></p>

<p>AngularJS (<a href="https://angularjs.org">https://angularjs.org</a>)<strong> </strong><span>(version 1.x) is a client-side MVVM framework, maintained by Google, which helps to develop <strong>Single Page Applications </strong>(<strong>SPA</strong>). It is based on a declarative programming model and it extends standard HTML with the ability to add additional behavior, elements, and attributes through directives. </span></p>
<p>Angular (<a href="https://angular.io">https://angular.io</a><span>)(version 2 and above) is a complete rewrite of the framework and hence is not backward compatible with AngularJS. Angular is written in TypeScript and recommends the use of TypeScript to write Angular applications as well. Angular removed some of the concepts that were used in AngularJS such as scope, controller, factory, and so on. It also has a different syntax for binding attributes and events. Another major difference is that the Angular library is modular and hence you can choose the modules that you need, to reduce bundle size. Angular also introduced advanced concepts such as <strong>AOT </strong>(<strong>Ahead of Time Compilation</strong>), lazy loading, reactive programming, and so on.</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span class="packt_screen">TypeScript</span> is a superset of ECMAScript 6 (ES6 - version 6 of JavaScript) and is backward compatible with ES5. It has additional features such as static typing, generics, class attribute visibility modifiers, and so on. Since TypeScript is a superset of ES6, we can also use ES6 features (<a href="http://es6-features.org">http://es6-features.org</a>) such as modules, lambdas (arrow functions), generators, iterators, string templates, reflection, spread operators, and so on.</div>

<p>React (<a href="https://reactjs.org">https://reactjs.org</a>) is not a full-fledged MVVM framework. It is a JavaScript library for building client-side views or user interfaces. It is developed and backed by Facebook and has a vibrant community and ecosystem behind it. React follows an HTML in JS approach and has a special format called <strong>JSX</strong> to help us write React components. Unlike Angular, React doesn't have too many concepts or APIs to learn and hence is easier to start with, but React only cares about rendering the UI and hence to get similar functionality offered by Angular, we would have to pair React with other libraries like React Router (<a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router">https://reacttraining.com/react-router</a>), Redux (<a href="https://redux.js.org">https://redux.js.org</a>), MobX (<a href="https://mobx.js.org">https://mobx.js.org</a>), and so on. JHipster uses React along with Redux and React Router and similar to Angular, JHipster uses TypeScript for React as well. But this is optional as React can be written using JavaScript as well, preferably ES6 (<a href="http://es6-features.org">http://es6-features.org</a>). React is fast to render due to its use of a virtual DOM (<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html">https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html</a>) to manipulate a view instead of using the actual browser DOM.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">If<span> you are starting a new project, it is best to choose either </span>Angular or React<span> as they are well maintained. However, with older versions of JHipster, AngularJS 1.x was also offered as an option but it is becoming legacy and will soon be discontinued in JHipster 5.x. JHipster will provide an official blueprint for those who are still interested in using AngularJS 1.x. Just run the command </span><kbd>jhipster --blueprint generator-jhipster-angularjs</kbd><span> to use it.</span></div>

<p>The client side has evolved a lot and become as complex as the server side, hence it <span>requires a lot more tools in your toolbelt to produce optimized results. You would need a build tool to transpile, minimize, and optimize your HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code. One of the most popular is Webpack. JHipster uses Webpack for Angular and React.</span></p>

<p>Webpack (<a href="https://webpack.js.org">https://webpack.js.org</a>) is a module bundler with a very flexible loader/plugin system. Webpack walks through the dependency graph and passes it through the configured loaders and plugins. With Webpack, you can transpile TypeScript to JavaScript, minimize, and optimize CSS and JS, compile Sass, revision, hash your assets, and so on. Webpack can remove dead code in a process called <strong>tree shaking</strong>, thus reducing bundle size. Webpack is configured using a configuration file and can be run from the command line or via NPM/YARN scripts.</p>

<p>Gone are the days when the client-side code didn't require unit testing. With the evolution of client-side frameworks, the testing possibilities also improved. There are many frameworks and tools available for unit testing, end-to-end testing, and so on. JHipster creates unit tests for client-side code using Karma and Jasmine out-of-the-box and also supports creating end-to-end tests using Protractor.</p>

<p>Internationalization (i18n) is a very important feature these days and JHipster supports this out-of-the-box. Multiple languages can be chosen during application creation. On the client side, this is achieved by storing GUI text in JSON files per language and using an Angular/React library to dynamically load this based on the language selected at runtime.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Do you know why internationalization is abbreviated as <span class="packt_screen">i18n</span>? Because there are 18 characters between <span class="packt_screen">I</span> and <span class="packt_screen">N</span>. There are other similarly named abbreviations in web technology, for example, <span class="packt_screen">Accessibility</span>(<span class="packt_screen">a11y</span>), <span><span class="packt_screen">Localization</span> (</span><span class="packt_screen">l10n</span><span>), <span class="packt_screen">Globalization</span> (</span><span class="packt_screen">g11n</span><span>), and <span class="packt_screen">Localizability</span> (</span><span class="packt_screen">l12y</span><span>).</span></div>

<p>Server-side technologies in web development have evolved a lot, and with the rise of frameworks such as Spring and Play, the need for Java EE has reduced and opened doors for more feature-rich alternatives, such as Spring Boot, for example. Some of the core technologies such as Hibernate are here to stay, while newer concepts such as JWT, Liquibase, Swagger, Kafka, and WebSockets bring a lot of additional opportunities. Let us take a quick look at some of the important technologies supported by JHipster; we will encounter these later on in the book and will take a deeper look at some of these technologies.</p>

<p>The Spring Framework (<a href="https://spring.io">https://spring.io</a>) might be the best thing since sliced bread in the Java world. It changed the Java web application landscape for the good. The landscape was monopolized by JavaEE vendors before the rise of Spring and soon after Spring, it became the number one choice for Java web developers, giving JavaEE a run for its money. At its core, Spring is an <strong>Inversion of Control</strong> (<strong>IoC</strong>) (<a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans">https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans</a>) container providing dependency injection and application context. The main features of Spring or the Spring triangle, combine IoC, <strong>Aspect-Oriented Programming </strong>(<strong>AOP</strong>) (<a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop">https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop</a>), and technology abstractions together in a consistent way. The framework has numerous modules aimed at different tasks, such as data management, security, REST, web services, and so on. Spring Framework and its modules are free and open source. Let us see some of the important modules in a bit more detail.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">IoC<span> is a software design pattern where custom or task-specific code is invoked by a library, rather than the traditional procedural programming approach where custom code calls libraries when required. IoC helps to make the code more modular and extendable.</span> AOP<span> provides another way of thinking about program structure. The unit of modularity is the aspect that enables the modularization of concerns such as transaction management that cut across multiple types and objects.</span></div>

<p>Spring Boot (<a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot">https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot</a>) is a widely used solution these days for Java web application development. It has an opinionated convention over configuration approach. It is completely configuration driven and makes using Spring Framework and many other third-party libraries a pleasure. Spring Boot applications are production grade and can just <em>run</em> in any environment that has a JVM installed. It uses an embedded servlet container such as Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow to run the application. It auto-configures Spring wherever possible and has starter POM for many modules and third-party libraries. It does not require any XML configuration and lets you customize autoconfigured beans using Java configuration.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">JHipster by default uses Undertow as the embedded server in the applications generated. <span class="packt_screen">Undertow</span> is very lightweight and faster to start, and is ideal for the development and production of lightweight applications.</div>

<p>Spring Security (<a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-security">https://projects.spring.io/spring-security</a>) is the de facto solution for security in a Spring Framework-based application. It provides API and utilities to manage all aspects of security, such as authentication and authorization. It supports a wide range of authentication mechanism <span>such as</span> OAuth2, JWT, Session (Web form), LDAP, <strong>SSO</strong> (<strong>Single Sign-On</strong>) servers, <strong>JAAS</strong> (<strong>Java Authentication and Authorization Service</strong>), Kerberos, and so on. It also has features <span>such as</span> remember me, concurrent session, and so on.</p>

<p>Spring MVC (<a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html">https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html</a>) is the default solution to work with the Servlet API within Spring applications. It is a request-based system and abstracts the Servlet API to make it easier to design controllers to serve HTTP requests. REST is the de facto standard for designing API endpoints these days and Spring MVC REST is a specific subset that makes it easier to design and implement RESTful services.</p>

<p>Spring data (<a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-data">http://projects.spring.io/spring-data</a>) is a module that abstracts data access operations for many different data access technologies and databases. It provides a consistent API to work seamlessly with different underlying implementations. This frees us from worrying about the underlying database and data access technology. It has powerful features <span>such as</span> dynamic query generation from method names, custom object mapping abstractions, and so on. Spring data supports working with JPA, MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch to name a few. It also lets you export Spring data repositories as RESTful resources.</p>

<p><strong>JSON Web Token</strong><span> </span><span>(</span><span>JWT</span><span>) (</span><a href="https://jwt.io">https://jwt.io</a><span>) is an open industry standard for security tokens. JWT authentication works by a server and client passing and verifying claims. A server generates a JWT token and passes it back to the client when user credentials are successfully validated. The client will store this token locally and use it to request protect resources from the server later by passing the token in the request header. This is a stateless authentication mechanism. This is explained in detail in</span> <a href="49b2ec94-463c-415c-a2f5-0d4e6c2943b7.xhtml">Chapter 9</a><span>,</span> <em>Building Microservices with JHipster</em><span>.</span></p>

<p>Session-based authentication is the traditional web form-based authentication mechanism where the server creates and maintains a session for the validated user credentials. This is stateful and normally is not very scalable unless you use a distributed HTTP session, which is possible using a distributed cache <span>such as</span> Hazelcast or using the session replication features of a dedicated web server or load balancer. JHipster adds a lot of features on top of the standard mechanism, <span>such as</span> secured tokens that are stored in DB, and can be invalidated, used in remember me mechanisms, and so on.</p>

OAuth2 is more complicated to set up when compared to the previously mentioned mechanisms. JHipster supports setting up OAuth with <strong>OpenID Connect</strong><span> </span><span>(</span><span>OIDC</span><span>) and can use Keycloak (</span><a href="https://keycloak.org">https://keycloak.org</a><span>) or Okta (</span><a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/10/20/oidc-with-jhipster">https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/10/20/oidc-with-jhipster</a><span>) out of the box.</span></p>

<p>Maven (<a href="https://maven.apache.org">https://maven.apache.org</a>) is a build automation tool that uses an XML document called <kbd>pom.xml</kbd> to specify how an application is built and its dependencies. Plugins and dependencies are downloaded from a central server and cached locally. The Maven build file is called a <strong>Project Object Model</strong><span> </span><span>(</span><span>POM</span><span>) and it describes the build process itself. Maven has a long history and is much more stable and reliable compared to Gradle. It also has a huge ecosystem of plugins.</span></p>

<p>Gradle (<a href="https://gradle.org">https://gradle.org</a>) is a build automation tool which uses a Groovy DSL to specify the build plan and dependencies. It is a strong contender rapidly gaining popularity and adoption. Gradle is much more flexible and feature-rich than Maven, making it an ideal choice for very complex build setups. The latest version of Gradle easily surpasses Maven in terms of speed and features. Another unique advantage of Gradle is the ability to write standard Groovy code in the build script, making it possible to do pretty much everything programmatically. It has great plugin support as well.</p>

<p>Hibernate (<a href="http://hibernate.org">http://hibernate.org</a>) is the most popular <strong>ORM </strong>(<strong>Object Relational Mapping</strong>) tool for Java. It helps to map an object-oriented domain model to a relational database scheme using Java annotations. It implements <strong>JPA </strong>(<strong>Java Persistence API</strong>) and is the go-to provider for a JPA implementation. Hibernate also offers many additional features <span>such as</span> entity auditing, bean validation, and so on. Hibernate automatically generates SQL queries depending on the underlying database semantics and makes it possible to switch the databases of an application very easily. It also makes the application database independent without any vendor lock-in. Hibernate is free and open source software.</p>

<p>WebSocket (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API</a>) is a communication protocol that works on top of TCP. It provides a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection. It was standardized by W3C (<a href="https://www.w3.org">https://www.w3.org</a>). It is lightweight and enables real-time communication between a client and server. In terms of web applications, this enables the server to communicate with the client app in the browser without a request from the client. This opens the door to pushing data from server to client in real-time and for implementations <span>such as</span> real time chat, notifications, and so on. On the server side, JHipster relies on Spring, which provides the necessary support (<a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-stomp-websocket/">https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-stomp-websocket/</a>) to work with WebSocket.</p>

<p>SQL databases or <span><strong>Relational Database Management Systems</strong> (<strong>RDBMS</strong>) are those that support a relational table-oriented data model. They support table schema defined by the fixed name and number of columns/attributes with a fixed data type. Each row in a table contains a value for every column. Tables can be related to each other.</span></p>

<p>You will need to use a command-line interface (Command Prompt or Terminal application) throughout this section and hence it is better to have one open. Since the installation of some of the following tools will alter the environment variables, you might have to close and reopen the Terminal after the installation of a tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, use the default <strong>Command Prompt</strong> (<strong>CMD</strong>) or Powershell</li>
<li>On Linux, use Bash or your favorite Terminal emulator</li>
<li>On macOS, use <span>iTerm</span> or your favorite Terminal application</li>

<p>Java 9 is the latest Java release introducing features like modules, reactive streams and so on. While JHipster applications will work with Java 9 it is recommended to stick to the more stable Java 8 until Java 9 support is stable in all the dependencies used.</p>
<p>The generated applications use Java 8 and hence it is required to compile the <span>applications:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Check for your installed Java version by running the command <kbd>java -version</kbd> in the Terminal. It should display <kbd>java version "1.8.x"</kbd> where x could be any patch version.<br/></span></li>
<li><span>If you do not have the correct version installed, you can visit the Oracle website (<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>) and follow the instructions to install the JDK for Java 8.</span></li>
<li><span>Once installed, check the command in step 1 again to make sure. As the JDK alters the environment variable to set <kbd>JAVA_HOME</kbd> you would have to open a new Terminal here.</span></li>

<p>Yarn is a package manager for NodeJS. It is API and feature compatible with NPM and provides better performance and a flat package tree.</p>
<p>JHipster, by default, uses Yarn instead of NPM as Yarn is much faster at the time of writing. If you prefer to use NPM, then you can skip this step:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can visit the Yarn website (<a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install">https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install</a>) and follow the instructions to install Yarn.</li>
<li><span>Once installed, check by running <kbd>yarn --version</kbd> to make sure.</span></li>

<p>Docker is the defacto standard for container management and it made using containers a breeze. It provides tools to create, share and deploy containers.</p>
<p> You will need Docker and <kbd>docker-compose</kbd> to run the generated database images and for the development of microservices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check for Docker by running <kbd>docker -v</kbd> in a terminal. It should display a version number.</li>
<li>Check for <kbd>docker-compose</kbd> by running <kbd>docker-compose -v</kbd> in a Terminal. It should display a version number. If you are on Mac or Linux you could just run <kbd>docker -v &amp;&amp; docker-compose -v</kbd> together.</li>
<li><span>If the command is not found, you can visit the Docker website (<a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/">https://docs.docker.com/install/</a>) and follow the instructions to install it. Also, install Docker Compose (<a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/</a>) by following the instructions.</span></li>

<p>JHipster applications can be created by using a command-line interface and JHipster CLI. Technically speaking, an IDE is not a requirement but when you continue development of a generated application it is highly recommended that you use a proper Java IDE <span>such as</span> IntelliJ, Eclipse, or Netbeans. Sometimes you could also use advanced text editors <span>such as</span> Visual Studio Code or Atom with appropriate plugins to get the work done. Depending on the IDE/text editor you choose, it is recommended to use the following plugins to make development more productive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Angular/React: Tslint, TypeScript, <span>editor config</span></li>
<li>Java: Spring, Gradle/Maven, Java Language support (VS Code)</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of IDE/text Editor, always exclude the folders <kbd>node_modules</kbd>, <kbd>git</kbd>, <kbd>build</kbd>, and <kbd>target</kbd> to speed up indexing. Some IDEs will do this automatically based on the <kbd>.gitignore</kbd> file.</p>

<p>Before installing and diving into JHipster, here are a few pointers to prepare you for some of the common issues that one might encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li>When using Yarn on macOS or Linux, you need to have <span><kbd>$HOME/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/.bin</kbd> in the path. This will normally be automatically done when you install Yarn but if not, y</span><span>ou can run the command <kbd>export PATH="$PATH:`yarn global bin`:$HOME/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/.bin"</kbd> in a Terminal to do this.</span></li>
<li>If you are behind a corporate proxy, you will have to bypass it for NPM, Bower, and Maven/Gradle to work properly. Visit <a href="http://www.jhipster.tech/configuring-a-corporate-proxy/">http://www.jhipster.tech/configuring-a-corporate-proxy/</a> to see what proxy options can be set for different tools used.</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_tip">If you are on Mac or Linux and if you are using Oh-My-Zsh or the Fisherman shell then you could use the specific plugins from JHipster for that. Visit <a href="http://www.jhipster.tech/shell-plugins/">http://www.jhipster.tech/shell-plugins/</a> for details.</div>

<p>OK, now let's get started for real. JHipster can be used from a local installation with NPM or Yarn, from a Vagrant image provided by the team, or using a Docker image. Alternatively, there is also the JHipster online application we saw earlier.</p>
<p>Among all the options, the best way to utilize the full power of JHipster would be by installing the JHipster CLI using Yarn or NPM. Open a Terminal and run:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt; yarn add global generator-jhipster</strong></pre>
<p>If you would prefer NPM, then just run:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt; npm install -g generator-jhipster</strong></pre>
<p>Wait for the installation to finish and in the Terminal run <kbd>jhipster --version</kbd>. You should see the version info as shown here:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="48" src="assets/ed5d567c-fccc-4564-b9d8-c115205405d6.png" width="382"/> </div>
<p><span>That's it; we are ready to roll. </span></p>
<div class="packt_tip">If you are someone who cannot wait for new versions to arrive, you can always use the current development code by following these steps after installing the JHipster CLI following the preceding steps:<br/>
<ol>
<li>In a Terminal, navigate to a directory you would like to use. For example, if you have a folder called <kbd>project</kbd> in your home directory, run <kbd>cd ~/projects/</kbd> and for Windows run <kbd>cd <span>c:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Desktop\projects</span></kbd></li>
<li>Run, <kbd>git clone https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster.git</kbd></li>
<li>Now, navigate to the folder by running <kbd>cd generator-jhipster</kbd></li>
<li>Run <kbd>npm link</kbd> to create a symbolic link from this folder into the globally installed application in <kbd>global <span>node_modules</span></kbd></li>
<li>Now when you run the JHipster commands you will be using the version you cloned instead of the version you installed</li>
</ol>
Please note that you should be doing this only if you are absolutely sure of what you are doing. Also please note that development versions of the software will always be unstable and might contain bugs.</div>
<p>If you prefer to isolate the installation in a virtual environment, then you can use the Vagrant development box or the Docker image from the JHipster team. Visit <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-devbox">https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-devbox</a> for instructions to use the Vagrant box or visit <a href="http://www.jhipster.tech/installation">http://www.jhipster.tech/installation</a> and scroll down to the Docker installation (for advanced users only) section for instructions to use a Docker image.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we discovered JHipster and the different technology options provided by it. We had a brief introduction of the important pieces of the client-side and server-side stack. We had a quick overview of Spring technologies, Angular, Bootstrap, and so on. We also had an overview of different database options supported by JHipster. We learned about the tools required to work with JHipster and we have successfully set up our environment to work with JHipster and installed JHipster CLI. In the next chapter, we will see how JHipster can be used to build a production-grade monolithic web application.</p>
