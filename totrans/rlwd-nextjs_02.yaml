    of modern JavaScript frameworks, creating dynamic web applications was complex,
    and it required many different libraries and configurations to make them work
    as expected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Angular, React, Vue, and all the other frameworks have enabled the web to evolve
    very quickly, and brought with them some very innovative ideas to frontend web
    development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: React, in particular, was created by *Jordan Walke* at Facebook and was heavily
    influenced by the *XHP Hack Library*. XHP allowed Facebook's PHP and Hack developers
    to create reusable components for the frontend of their applications. The JavaScript
    library became open source in 2013 and forever changed how we build websites,
    web apps, native apps (with **React Native** later on), and even VR experiences
    (with **React VR**). As a result, React has quickly become one of the most loved
    and popular JavaScript libraries, with millions of websites using it in production
    for many different purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There was just one problem: by default, React runs on the **client side** (meaning
    that it runs on the web browser), so a web application written entirely with that
    library could negatively affect **Search Engine Optimization** (**SEO**) and initial
    load performance, as it takes some time to be correctly rendered on screen. In
    fact, to display the complete web app, the browser had to download the entire
    application bundle, parse its content, then execute it and render the result in
    the browser, which could take up to a few seconds (with very large applications).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many companies and developers started investigating how to pre-render the application
    on the server, letting the browser display the rendered React app as plain HTML,
    making it interactive as soon as the JavaScript bundle has been transferred to
    the client.

    out of the box, such as automatic code-splitting, server-side rendering, file-based
    routing systems, route pre-fetching, and so on. Next.js showed how easy it should
    be to write universal web applications by allowing developers to write reusable
    code for both client and server sides and making very complex tasks (such as code-splitting
    and server-side rendering) effortless to implement.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One popular alternative is Gatsby. You may want to consider this framework if
    you seek to build static websites. Unlike Next.js, Gatsby only supports static
    site generation and does it incredibly well. Every page is pre-rendered at build
    time and can be served on any **Content Delivery Network** (**CDN**) as a static
    asset, allowing the performance to be incredibly competitive compared to dynamically
    server-side rendered alternatives. The biggest downside of using Gatsby over Next.js
    is that you'll lose the ability of dynamic server-side rendering, which is an
    important feature for building more dynamically data-driven and complex websites.

    They both offer support for server-side rendering, static site generation, progressive
    web app management, and so on, with no significant differences regarding performance,
    SEO, or development speed. While Nuxt.js and Next.js serve the same purpose, Nuxt.js
    needs more configuration, which is sometimes not a bad thing. In your Nuxt.js
    configuration file, you can define layouts, global plugins and components, routes,
    and so on, while with Next.js, you need to do it *the React way*. Apart from that,
    they share many functionalities, but the most significant difference is the library
    underneath. That said, if you already have a Vue component library, you could
    consider Nuxt.js for server-side rendering it.

    and deployment options, although they're probably the most complete I've ever
    seen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to support you at every step you take in building your application. I would consider
    this as a huge bonus point, because as soon as you have a problem with your code
    base, you'll be able to get help from the massive community across many different
    platforms, including StackOverflow and GitHub, where the Vercel team is also often
    involved in discussions and support requests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    see the main differences between a default client-side React app and a fully-featured
    server-side environment for rendering your JavaScript code base dynamically for
    each request, and statically at build time.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you already have some experience with React, you'll find it incredibly easy
    to build your first Next.js website. Its philosophy is very close to React and
    provides a *convention-over-configuration* approach for most of its settings,
    so if you want to take advantage of a specific Next.js feature, you'll easily
    find the official way for doing it without any need for complex configurations.
    An example? In a single Next.js app, you can specify which pages shall be server-side
    rendered and which shall be statically generated at build time without the need
    to write any configuration files or anything like that. You just have to export
    a specific function from your page and let Next.js do its magic (we'll see that
    in [*Chapter 2*](B16985_02_Final_SB_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor029)*, Exploring Different
    Rendering Strategies*).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most significant difference between React and Next.js is that while React
    is just a JavaScript library, Next.js is a framework for building rich and complete
    user experiences both on the client and server sides, adding tons of incredibly
    useful features. Every server-side rendered or statically generated page will
    run on Node.js, so you'll lose access to some browser-specific global objects,
    such as `fetch`, `window`, and `document`, as well as some HTML elements such
    as `canvas`. You will always need to keep that in mind when you're writing your
    Next.js pages, even if the framework provides its own way for dealing with components
    that *must* use such global variables and HTML elements, as we'll see in[*Chapter
    2*](B16985_02_Final_SB_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor029)*, Exploring Different Rendering
    Strategies*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, there might be times when you want to use Node.js specific
    libraries or APIs, such as `fs` or `child_process`, and Next.js allows you to
    use them by running your server-side code on each request or at build time (depending
    on how you choose to render your pages) before sending the data to the client.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But even if you want to create a client-side rendered app, Next.js can be a
    great alternative to the well-known `create-react-app`. Next.js, in fact, can
    be used as a framework for writing progressive and offline-first web apps with
    ease, taking advantage of its incredible built-in components and optimizations.

    If you're not very familiar with it, let me quickly explain what I'm talking about.
    Babel is a JavaScript transcompiler mainly used for transforming modern JavaScript
    code into a backward-compatible script, which will run without problem on any
    browser.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're writing a web app that *must* support older browsers such as **Internet
    Explorer** (**IE**) 10 or Internet Explorer 11, Babel will help you a lot. It
    allows you to use modern ES6/ESNext features and will transform them into IE-compatible
    code at build time, letting you maintain a beautiful developer experience with
    very few compromises.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, the JavaScript language (standardized under the ECMAScript specification)
    is quickly evolving. So while some fantastic features have already been announced,
    you'll have to wait for years before being able to use them in both browsers and
    Node.js environments. That's because after the ECMA committee has accepted these
    features, the companies developing web browsers and communities working on the
    Node.js project will have to plan a roadmap for adding support for these enhancements.
    Babel solves this problem by transpiling modern code into a compatible script
    for today's environments.

    into a single bundle to be shipped to the client. To put it simply, we can think
    of webpack as an infrastructure for orchestrating different compilation, bundle,
    and minification tasks for every web asset (JavaScript files, CSS, SVG, and so
    on).

    your app styles, you will need to customize the default webpack configuration
    to parse **SASS**/**LESS** files and produce plain CSS as output. The same, of
    course, occurs for JavaScript code using Babel as a transpiler.

    for now, we just need to keep in mind that Next.js provides an easy way for customizing
    the default webpack configuration.

- en: As we saw earlier, Next.js provides a *convention-over-configuration* approach,
    so you don't need to customize most of its settings for building a real-world
    application; you just have to follow some code conventions.

    default settings via the `next.config.js` file most of the time. You can create
    this file inside the root of your project. It should export an object by default,
    where its properties will override the default Next.js configurations:'

    be merged with Next.js' default settings. This will allow us to extend, override,
    or even delete any setting from the default configuration, as although deleting
    default settings is generally never a good idea, there might be cases where you
    need it (if you're brave enough!).

    React apps and Next.js, and how Next.js compares with other well-known alternatives.
    You've also learned how to customize a default Next.js project by editing the
    Babel and webpack configurations, as well as adding TypeScript as an alternative
    to JavaScript for developing your applications.
