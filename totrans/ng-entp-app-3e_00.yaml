- en: Welcome to the wonderful world of Angular enterprise development! Standalone
    projects, signals, and the control flow syntax have injected fresh blood into
    the framework. At the time that this book is published, Angular 17.1 has been
    released with features to bring Signals-based components closer to reality, keeping
    the Angular ecosystem as vibrant as ever. If this trajectory holds, by Angular
    20, the framework will be easier than ever to use and will make it possible to
    create reliable and high-performance applications of any size. This new edition
    of the book refocuses the content on enterprise architecture and continues the
    journey toward mastering sophisticated and scalable Angular solutions ready for
    complex business needs.

- en: Much like the previous edition, this book has been meticulously designed to
    equip you with indispensable knowledge and pragmatic examples so you can architect,
    build, and deliver robust Angular applications. The emphasis remains on adopting
    an efficient and minimalist approach – maximizing the capabilities of Angular
    itself and eschewing unnecessary dependencies. This results in streamlined code
    that is simpler to maintain as Angular continues its rapid pace of progress.

- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Angular’s Architecture and Concepts*, introduces Angular as a
    mature platform for building sophisticated, high-performance web applications
    using TypeScript, RxJS, and NgRx. It introduces key concepts like reactive programming,
    the Flux pattern, standalone components, fine-grained reactivity with Signals,
    and the importance of keeping Angular updated.'

- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Forms, Observables, Signals, and Subjects*, covers creating search
    functionality, using forms, enabling interaction between components, avoiding
    memory leaks, comparing imperative and reactive programming, chaining API calls,
    using signals for better performance, and building a small weather application
    to demonstrate basic Angular concepts.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Architecting an Enterprise App*, covers best practices and considerations
    for succeeding as a technical lead or architect on an enterprise Angular project,
    including ingredients for running a successful project, why Angular suits enterprise
    needs, performance optimization tools and techniques like the 80-20 rule and Router-first
    architecture, and agile planning with Kanban boards.'
