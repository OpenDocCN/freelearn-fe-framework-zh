			<h1 id="_idParaDest-73"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Chapter 4</em>: Move It! Animating Our First Lottie With After Effects</h1>
			<p>And... here we are! Ready to start our own first animated project in Adobe After Effects! Yes! It has been an exciting journey, and we've learned loads of new words, concepts, and tools. Looking back, it seems like ages ago when we started talking about Lottie, don't you think? Not because of the matter of time, but because we've learned so many new things! In the first part of the book, we learned what Lottie and LottieFiles are, we went through the history and principles of 2D classic animation, and got our hands on the Adobe After Effects working area and main animating features. Now, we are all ready and set to animate our icon.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to go step by step through creating our animated icon. Get ready, as we are going to put everything we've learned so far on the table, all the knowledge we've gained about Lottie, classic animation, and Adobe After Effects. We will learn how to import our assets from different vector-based tools, we will create and adjust our composition, create keyframes, and change layer properties to give the illusion of animation. We will also learn how to animate a path, adjust the timing, and apply ease, based on classic animation concepts, to give our icon a more trustable movement. So, by the end of this chapter, we will have our first animated icon ready to be exported for LottieFiles.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Importing vector files into our Adobe <strong class="bold">After Effects</strong> (<strong class="bold">AE</strong>) project from different design tools such as Sketch, Figma, and Adobe XD</li>
				<li>Setting up the composition for our animated icon</li>
				<li>Creating keyframes</li>
				<li>Animating our icon by changing layer properties</li>
				<li>Being time efficient by learning how to use Trim Paths and radial burst effects</li>
				<li>Adding ease and adjusting timing to polish our animation</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>Remember that this chapter is a hands-on project, and in order to be able to complete it successfully, it is important you have the following tools up and running:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adobe AE.</li>
				<li>A vector illustration software of your choice. We will be focusing on Sketch, Figma, and Adobe XD:<ul><li><strong class="bold">If you use Sketch</strong>: You need the AEUX plugin for Sketch installed.</li><li><strong class="bold">If you use Figma</strong>: You need the AEUX plugin for Figma installed.</li><li><strong class="bold">If you use Adobe XD</strong>: There's no need to install any extra plugins.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Creating your first project in Adobe AE – an animated check icon</h1>
			<p>Cool, let me recap a<a id="_idIndexMarker180"/> bit here. Sometimes you may think, why go through all this effort to create an animation if we could just have a text or an illustration instead? Well, as we mentioned earlier, animations can be so helpful in terms of UX. They help us to talk to our users; we've learned how animation can communicate so many things, such as actions or emotions.</p>
			<p>If we go back to our brief, remember we've decided to create a check icon that will show the user the purchase has been successfully made and the money is safe and well spent.</p>
			<p>So, in UX terms, what sort of emotions do we want our users to feel? I guess something like the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Safety</strong>: The purchase has been made correctly. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Relief</strong>: The money hasn't been lost in the middle of the transaction.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Excitement</strong>: Imagine the feeling you have after treating yourself to a new T-shirt. Exciting, right?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When animating, we are not just talking about some cool motion graphics that will show up in our app to make it look better; instead, we are talking about making our users' lives easier and <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>happier. We are talking about making people feel better! Can you see the power we've got in our hands? So, let's not waste any more time. Let's make our users feel great!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Importing our icon to After Effects</h1>
			<p>Let's start <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>by importing <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>our assets to AE. To do that, we assume you already have your icon design ready in any of these three vector-based tools: Sketch, Figma, or Adobe XD.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important</p>
			<p class="callout">If you don't have any vector-based tool chosen yet, I would recommend using Adobe XD, which will save you time and effort. The exporting option for XD is already included in XD and there is no need to add any extra extensions or plugins. However, if you already use Sketch or Figma, no worries, we will cover that too. Also, you can find more information about how to install the plugins in <a href="B17930_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Don't Stop! Exploring Plugins and Resources That Will Keep You Going</em>, of this book.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Importing files from Sketch to AE</h2>
			<p>In order to <a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>avoid some animation <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>issues, I always recommend keeping the illustrations as tidy and as simple as possible. For example, some Boolean operations, text layers, or symbols can generate problems when exporting to AE.</p>
			<p>That said, let's open our icon in Sketch. Go to the top bar menu and select <strong class="bold">File </strong>| <strong class="bold">Open Local Document</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer104" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_01.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – Sketch File menu&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 – Sketch File menu</p>
			<p>Go to the <strong class="source-inline">Files</strong> folder <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>provided with this <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>book and open <strong class="source-inline">lottie/chapter04/ sketch/lottie_sketch</strong>.</p>
			<p>Now is the time to install the AEUX plugin for both Sketch and AE. You'll find more information on how to install AEUX for Sketch and AE in <a href="B17930_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Don't Stop! Exploring Plugins and Resources That Will Keep You Going</em>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important</p>
			<p class="callout">If you installed the plugin without following our instructions, please check the <em class="italic">How to set up AEUX in AE</em> section in <a href="B17930_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Don't Stop! Exploring Plugins and Resources That Will Keep You Going</em>, as some options have to be selected.</p>
			<p>Once we have our AEUX plugin installed in Sketch, let's open it up and check the panel. To do that, go to the top bar menu and select <strong class="bold">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold">AEUX</strong> | <strong class="bold">Open panel</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer105" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2 – AEUX plugin panel window</p>
			<p>As we <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>can<a id="_idIndexMarker189"/> see in <em class="italic">Figure 4.3</em>, this is a very simple panel with just three different options:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer106" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_03.jpg" alt="Figure 4.3 – AEUX for Sketch plugin window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3 – AEUX for Sketch plugin window</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Send selection to Ae</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>is pretty <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>straightforward; by selecting the layers and clicking this option, we will export our illustration to AE.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Flatten shapes</strong>: As we mentioned earlier, when exporting for AE, it is always a good idea to keep our illustration and layers tidy. With the <strong class="bold">Flatten shapes</strong> option, we can flatten our grouped or Boolean layers into a flat vector single shape and avoid AE layer issues.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Detach symbols</strong>: Symbols may be confusing for AE to represent. With the <strong class="bold">Detach symbols</strong> option, we will remove the symbol dependence from its master so it will work better in AE.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So, as we can see here, our icon is composed of just two single layers: <strong class="bold">check</strong> for the blue check sign and <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> for the white circle. The layers are basic simple shapes that won't give us any trouble when exporting. Perfect!</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer107" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.4 – Layers panel</p>
			<p>Now that<a id="_idIndexMarker192"/> we've<a id="_idIndexMarker193"/> got our icon ready and tidy, let's export it to AE:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open Adobe AE if you haven't done that yet.</li>
				<li>Go back to Sketch and select both layers at the same time: <strong class="bold">check</strong> and <strong class="bold">Oval</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Send selection to Ae</strong> in the AEUX panel.</li>
				<li>Go to Adobe AE and check that the files have been imported:</li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.5 – Imported layers from Sketch to AE</p>
			<p>Great! We've got<a id="_idIndexMarker194"/> our icon perfectly imported<a id="_idIndexMarker195"/> into AE and ready to be animated. Just save it! Now, let's see how to do the same using the Figma tool. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Importing files from Figma to AE</h2>
			<p>To export<a id="_idIndexMarker196"/> your illustrations from Figma to AE, the<a id="_idIndexMarker197"/> process is quite similar. You can go to <a href="B17930_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Don't Stop! Exploring Plugins and Resources That Will Keep You Going</em>, where you'll find a guide on how to install the plugin for Figma and also AE. Remember, if you have installed the plugin on your own, please check the <em class="italic">How to set up AEUX in AE</em> section to be sure the selected options are the same as you have.</p>
			<p>Now that you have your plugins up and running, let's open the icon in Figma. How to do that? Follow these instructions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open Figma.</li>
				<li>Choose the <strong class="bold">Import file</strong> option from the home page:</li>

				<li>Open the <strong class="source-inline">lottie_Figma.fig</strong> file.</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Done</strong> button. The file will appear on Figma's home page, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.7</em>:</li>

			<p>Cool! <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>Now, we've <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>got <strong class="source-inline">lottie_Figma.fig</strong> imported.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="7">Let's open the AEUX panel and check out the options available to export our icon to AE. Go to <strong class="bold">Plugins</strong> | <strong class="bold">Development </strong>| <strong class="bold">AEUX</strong>.</li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.9 – AEUX plugin panel window</p>
			<p>As we can<a id="_idIndexMarker205"/> see in <em class="italic">Figure 4.10</em>, this is a very <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>simple panel with just three different options:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer113" class="IMG---Figure">

			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Send selection to Ae</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>works<a id="_idIndexMarker208"/> the same way as in Sketch. It is pretty straightforward; by selecting the layers and clicking this option, we will export our illustration to AE.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Export reference image</strong>: There are a few known alignment issues with layers from Figma, such as text layers and rotated images. Enable this checkbox to generate an image overlay of the Figma frame to allow for manual alignment.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rasterize layer on export</strong>: It is possible to automatically send anything in Figma to AE as a PNG file. This becomes very useful for anything that doesn't need to be animated and could be optimized by flattening it down to a single image.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As we mentioned earlier, it is very important to keep our illustration as simple as possible, as some effects can generate issues. You'll notice our illustration is very simple; it is made of just two layers named <strong class="bold">check</strong> and <strong class="bold">Oval</strong>, and that's all we need.</p>
			<p>Now that our icon is done and tidy, let's export it to AE:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open Adobe AE if you haven't done that yet.</li>
				<li>Go back to Figma and select both layers at the same time: <strong class="bold">check</strong> and <strong class="bold">Oval</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Send selection to Ae</strong> AEUX panel option.</li>
				<li>Go to<a id="_idIndexMarker209"/> Adobe AE and check <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>that the files have been imported:</li>

			<p>Cool! We've got <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>our icon ready to go in AE; now, remember<a id="_idIndexMarker212"/> to save it! Let's see how to do the same with XD.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Exporting assets from XD to AE</h2>
			<p>Exporting your <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>icon from XD to AE is<a id="_idIndexMarker214"/> probably the easiest way that exists right now. There is no need to install any plugin as Adobe XD already includes an exporting option for AE. Let's have a look. Let's open the XD file provided with this book.</p>
			<p>Let's open our icon in Adobe XD. To do this, just follow the next steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open XD.</li>
				<li>Go to <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Open from Your Computer...</strong>.</li>

			<p>Now, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>see how easy it is to export <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>our icon to AE:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the entire layout area by clicking on its name.</li>

			<p>Save the <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>project and let's start<a id="_idIndexMarker222"/> animating!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>UX animation workflow</h1>
			<p>Before we start <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>messing around with AE, I want to share with you the workflow I normally use when animating.</p>
			<p>You'll see we've been through half of the process already; now, we just need to bring it to life. And please, take this workflow as a suggestion and feel free to change it in any way to meet your own requirements. Here is my workflow: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">UX research to find user pain points.</li>
				<li>Spot problems/find solutions based on users' comments.</li>
				<li>Wireframing.</li>
				<li>Storyboard.</li>
				<li>Low fidelity design to test again.</li>
				<li>Design.</li>
				<li>Export assets to AE.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We have already covered all of these:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Set up compositions.</li>
				<li>Create keyframes.</li>
				<li>Modify layers.</li>
				<li>Adjust timing.</li>
				<li>Add ease.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We will cover the following in <a href="B17930_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor091"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Share It With the World: Working With LottieFiles</em>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Export as <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> for LottieFiles</li>
				<li>Preview in LottieFiles</li>
				<li>Hand off to developers</li>
			</ol>
			<p>I know, this process<a id="_idIndexMarker224"/> might look a bit long, but this is just an example that covers the whole process of a complex project. Sometimes, there won't be any need to run user interviews, or at some point, you won't need to draw a storyboard or wireframes as these will be in your head.</p>
			<p>Let's go back and see where we were, let's see where we left our storyboard. Let's recap; what was our icon doing?</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Our icon will increase from 0% to 110% approximately.</li>
				<li>Bubbles come out from the Oval-like sparkles.</li>
				<li>Oval goes back to real size (100%) and the bubbles start to disappear.</li>
				<li>While the bubbles disappear, the <em class="italic">check</em> symbol starts to draw.</li>
				<li>Finally, the <em class="italic">check</em> symbol is revealed at 100%:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer119" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_16.jpg" alt="Figure 4.16 – Our storyboard&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.16 – Our storyboard</p>
			<p>At this point, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>given you all the elements, resources, and tools necessary to have everything ready to start animating. We've been through a few main UX concepts, learned how to import our files to AE, checked one of many animation workflows, and gone through the storyboard again to refresh our minds.</p>
			<p>So, now that we've got a pretty clear idea in our heads and on paper about how the animation is going to look, what needs to be done, and the steps to follow, let's start animating! Let's create our compositions.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Adjusting our icon composition settings</h1>
			<p>Remember<a id="_idIndexMarker226"/> back in <a href="B17930_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor057"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Learning the Tools: Getting Familiar With After Effects</em>, we talked about compositions, what they are, and what we use them for? Cool. Now is the time to start putting everything we've learned into context.</p>
			<p>When we import our icon to AE, it normally gets imported as a <strong class="bold">composition</strong>. Remember, compositions are shown in the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel, and to open one, we just need to double-click on it.</p>
			<p>Now, how is this composition imported to AE? Are the main specifications of this composition the ones we want? Let's check it out. Let's check our <strong class="bold">Composition Settings</strong> icon:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer120" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_17.jpg" alt="Figure 4.17 – Composition Settings window view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.17 – Composition Settings window view</p>
			<p>Let's adjust some of these settings. Remember how to do that? Here are the instructions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select your composition from the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">Composition</strong> | <strong class="bold">Composition Settings</strong> from the top menu.</li>
				<li>Adjust the composition size to <strong class="bold">250</strong> x <strong class="bold">250</strong> px.</li>
				<li>Set the frame rate to <strong class="bold">60</strong> frames per second.</li>
				<li>Set the duration to <strong class="bold">2</strong> seconds.</li>
				<li>Change the background color to <strong class="source-inline">#989898</strong>. Notice that the background color won't be exported, but I'm changing it so we can see the white circle better.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>That was easy, right? Now <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>that we've got our composition ready, let's move to the <strong class="bold">Layers</strong> panel.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Understanding our check icon layers</h1>
			<p>We've got our icon<a id="_idIndexMarker228"/> composition sorted and adjusted to our needs; now is the time to understand how our icon is built in terms of layers, so, let's check what we've got in our layers panel. </p>
			<p>As you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 4.18</em>, when we check the Layer panel, we find the same two layers we had in our illustration file that we just imported, <strong class="bold">check</strong> and <strong class="bold">Oval</strong>.</p>
			<p>Just to be clear, <strong class="bold">check</strong> is a <em class="italic">stroke</em> and <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> is a <em class="italic">shape</em>. This is important and will help us to give the effect that we want to the <strong class="bold">check</strong> layer. But, don't worry for now; we will see that a few steps further in this section.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer121" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.18 – Layer panel with check and Oval layer properties</p>
			<p>Also, as you can see in <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>the preceding screenshot, each of our layers has a lot of sub-layers. We are going to be seeing this in the next steps.</p>
			<p>But first, let's recap. Remember, our animation will start with the oval getting bigger.</p>

			<p class="callout">Since we are going to be focusing on the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> for now, I recommend blocking and hiding the <strong class="bold">check</strong> layer as it is not relevant at this stage. Of course, we've just got two layers and there's probably no need to start hiding or blocking other layers, but when we start working with some more complicated projects, this is good to have as a habit.</p>
			<p>Click the little eye and lock icons from the Layer panel to hide and block any layer you want, as shown in the<a id="_idIndexMarker230"/> following screenshot:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Adding Keyframes</h1>
			<p>Great! Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>we are more familiar with our layers, and the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> is on its own, and there's no danger that we are going to move the <strong class="bold">check</strong> icon, even by mistake, let's start creating some movement.</p>
			<p>Remember back in <a href="B17930_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor057"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Learning the Tools: Getting Familiar With After Effects</em>, when we talked about keyframes? Exactly! Keyframes are used to create movement and to do that, we need at least two of them: one keyframe as a starting point and one as an ending point.</p>
			<p>That said, we want our <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> to grow from 0 to 100%, right? Any idea about how to do that? Sure, we will create two keyframes and change the scale of the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong>, so one keyframe will be 0% and the other 100%. Let's do that now.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Changing scale</h2>
			<p>We are going to <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>start by animating the scale. How do we do that? By adjusting the scale's <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> properties, at specific keyframes. Here's how to do it:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go to the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel.</li>
				<li>Open the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> layer's <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> properties. You could do that by selecting the layer and pressing <em class="italic">S</em>, but we will talk more about shortcuts in the following sections.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer123" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_20.jpg" alt="Figure 4.20 – Scale values for the Oval layer&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.20 – Scale values for the Oval layer</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Place the time slider at <strong class="bold">0</strong> frames.</li>
				<li>Click on the stopwatch of <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> to create our first keyframe:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer124" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_21.jpg" alt="Figure 4.21 – New keyframe for the Scale property&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.21 – New keyframe for the Scale property</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Move the<a id="_idIndexMarker233"/> time slider to frame <strong class="bold">30</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the little diamond at the left of the <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> property to create our second keyframe:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer125" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_22.jpg" alt="Figure 4.22 – Second keyframe&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.22 – Second keyframe</p>
			<p>Now, let's move the time slider left and right; can you notice anything different? Of course not. We've just created the keyframes but haven't changed the <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> property yet. Let's do that as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Move the time slider to frame <strong class="bold">0</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the keyframe we've just created.</li>
				<li>Set the <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> property's percentage to <strong class="bold">0%</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer126" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_23.jpg" alt="Figure 4.23 – Scale value to 0%&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.23 – Scale value to 0%</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Press the<a id="_idIndexMarker234"/> spacebar or move your time slider from left to right; is anything happening now? Yes! Our icon is finally doing something!</li>
				<li>Place the time slider back at <strong class="bold">0</strong> and press the spacebar. Do that a few times to check the animation; what do you think? Is the timing correct? It is maybe too slow? No worries, we will adjust that later when we talk about Ease.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, going back to our storyboard, we've defined the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> as scaling up to 110-120% and then going back to 100%. But, why are we doing that? Remember when we talked about 2D animation principles? For this little icon animation, we will be applying the <strong class="bold">Exaggeration</strong> and <strong class="bold">Stretch and Squash</strong> principles to our <strong class="bold">Oval</strong>, to give an idea of flexibility, mass, weight, and speed. So, simply exaggerating the size of it will give this impression.</p>
			<p>How to do that? Easy. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Move the time slider to frame <strong class="bold">25</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the diamond to create a new keyframe.</li>
				<li>Set the scale to 120%.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Press the spacebar to play our animation again. What do you think? With just this little tweak, our animation looks more real now; of course, the timing is still not good and is missing some <strong class="bold">Ease</strong>, but we are getting there.</p>
			<p>Let's stick to the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong>. Let's adjust the timing. To do that, we just need to drag our keyframes. I encourage you to play around and move them around the timeline to see how <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> behaves. I'll <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>set my <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> keyframes between frame <strong class="bold">0</strong>, frame <strong class="bold">18</strong>, and frame <strong class="bold">21</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer127" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_24.jpg" alt="Figure 4.24 – Scale keyframes&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.24 – Scale keyframes</p>
			<p>Let's move the time slider to <strong class="bold">0</strong> and play it again a few times. What do you think? It looks better now, right? What about scaling up and down, maybe we could adjust the size a little bit? Let's adjust the second keyframe to make it subtle, the one that scales up to 120%, and take it down to 110%. Play again, and... it now looks smoother. Right! Let's keep moving! Let's tweak the <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong> property to make our illustration even smoother.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Adjusting the Opacity</h2>
			<p>Now that we've<a id="_idIndexMarker236"/> got the <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> property as we want it, let's adjust the opacity. To do that, we are going to follow the same steps as we did in the previous section. Of course, we could have done both at the same time, but I preferred to show you step by step; there will be plenty of time to do things quicker, but we want to have the basics clear, right?</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important</p>
			<p class="callout">From now on, I'm going to start introducing some shortcuts that will save you tons of time and will help you be more productive. The shortcuts I'm using here are for macOS. Most of them are the same for macOS and Windows; however, if you are using a Windows system and you are not sure which shortcut to use, check <a href="B17930_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Don't Stop! Exploring Plugins and Resources That Will Keep You Going</em>, for a list of the most common and useful shortcuts for macOS and Windows.</p>
			<p>That said, let's change the opacity:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> layer.</li>
				<li>Press <em class="italic">T</em> to reveal the <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong> property (<em class="italic">T</em> stands for <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong>, <em class="italic">A</em> for <strong class="bold">Anchor Point</strong>, <em class="italic">S</em> for <strong class="bold">Scale</strong>, <em class="italic">P</em> for <strong class="bold">Position</strong>, and <em class="italic">R</em> for <strong class="bold">Rotation</strong>).</li>
				<li>Press <em class="italic">Shift</em> + <em class="italic">S</em> to show the <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> keyframes as well. We want to have that layer visible too, so by pressing <em class="italic">Shift</em> + <em class="italic">A</em>, <em class="italic">S</em>, <em class="italic">P</em>, or <em class="italic">R</em> we will open and close them without closing the rest.</li>
				<li>Place the time slider at keyframe <strong class="bold">0</strong>. We can move backward and forward between keyframes by pressing <em class="italic">K</em> to move to the next keyframe and <em class="italic">J</em> to the previous one.</li>
				<li>Press the <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong> layer stopwatch to create our keyframe. We can also do that by pressing <em class="italic">Option</em> + <em class="italic">T</em>.</li>
				<li>Change the <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong> value down to <strong class="source-inline">40</strong>%, for example:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer128" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_25.jpg" alt="Figure 4.25 – Opacity value&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.25 – Opacity value</p>
			<p>Nice! That's the <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>first keyframe created with a value of 40% opacity. Let's create a second keyframe:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Move the time slider to the next keyframe by pressing <em class="italic">K</em>.</li>
				<li>Press <img src="image/B17930_04_icon1.png" alt=""/> + <em class="italic">T</em> to create a new keyframe or click on the little diamond icon as we did earlier.</li>
				<li>Set the <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong> value to <strong class="source-inline">100</strong>%.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer130" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_26.jpg" alt="Figure 4.26 – Second keyframe opacity property value set to 100%&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.26 – Second keyframe opacity property value set to 100%</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Let's move the time slider to <strong class="bold">0</strong> and press the spacebar to check our animation again.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Looks good to me, at least for now. Once we add some ease to the animation, it will look much more realistic and flexible. But, let's go first to animate <strong class="bold">check</strong>.</p>
			<p>So, <strong class="bold">check</strong> behaves differently; it doesn't scale up or down or fade in, and is not rotating or moving<a id="_idIndexMarker238"/> either. What we've decided <strong class="bold">check</strong> will do is draw itself. How do we do that? Well, I'm going to show you how to use <strong class="bold">Trim Paths</strong>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Trim Paths</h1>
			<p>To show and <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>hide a path or reveal a part of it, we could be working with masks; however, Lottie doesn't work very well with them, at least not yet. Using masks can get us in trouble so we are going to try to avoid them and try something else.</p>
			<p>Another option could be to draw our <strong class="bold">check</strong> animation frame by frame, so the following keyframe always shows a little bit more of the drawing than the first one, but this would be very time-consuming!</p>
			<p>This is where Trim Paths comes into the picture. Using this option can be very helpful and time-saving. Let's see what this can do for us:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Block the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> layer. In that case, we are not going to hide this layer as it is behind the <strong class="bold">check</strong> layer.</li>
				<li>Show and unlock the <strong class="bold">check</strong> layer by pressing the little eye and lock icon.</li>
				<li>Open the <strong class="bold">check</strong> layer.</li>
				<li>Open the <strong class="bold">Contents</strong> properties and close everything else:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer131" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_27.jpg" alt="Figure 4.27 – Contents properties&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.27 – Contents properties</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Click on the <strong class="bold">Add arrow</strong> button and select the <strong class="bold">Trim Paths</strong> option:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer132" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_28.jpg" alt="Figure 4.28 – Selecting Trim Paths&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.28 – Selecting Trim Paths</p>
			<p>Now, let's check our <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/>Layer panel; what happened there? As you can see, a layer called <strong class="bold">Trim Paths 1</strong> has appeared. Let's open it up by clicking on the little arrow. A few different options come up; what are these?</p>
			<p>These new options will let us decide whether the <strong class="bold">check</strong> path starts drawing itself from the beginning of the path or the end. Instead of a drawing effect, it is more of an erasing effect.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer133" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_29.jpg" alt="Figure 4.29 – Trim Path options&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.29 – Trim Path options</p>
			<p>Let's mess around a bit with these options:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Place the time slider on keyframe <strong class="bold">0</strong>.</li>
				<li>Create a new keyframe at the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> layer.</li>
				<li>Set the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> value to <strong class="bold">0</strong>.</li>
				<li>Place the time slider on keyframe <strong class="bold">30</strong>.</li>
				<li>Create<a id="_idIndexMarker241"/> a new keyframe.</li>
				<li>Set the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> value to <strong class="source-inline">100</strong>%.</li>
				<li>Move the time slider back to <strong class="bold">0</strong>.</li>
				<li>Press the spacebar to check the animation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>What's happening here? It looks like <strong class="bold">check</strong> is doing what we wanted but the other way around. Instead of drawing itself, it is erasing itself. Right, this feature can be a bit confusing sometimes, but don't get frustrated! It took me a while to understand the logic behind it, and even now, sometimes I have to try it a few times to get it right. So, I encourage you to play around with the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> and <strong class="bold">End</strong> values to get used to the effect and its behavior.</p>
			<p>Now let's swap the values and try to get it right:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Let's set up the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> value at keyframe <strong class="bold">0</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">100</strong>%.</li>
				<li>Move to the next frame and set the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> value to <strong class="bold">0</strong>.</li>
				<li>Press the spacebar and check it out.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Great! Now, the <strong class="bold">check</strong> icon is doing it right. It starts from nothing to drawing itself, as if someone was writing it, right? We've got it! However, the animation is not placed in the right place.</p>
			<p>Notice that the <strong class="bold">check</strong> animation is starting before the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> is 100% on screen. If we take a look at our timeline (see <em class="italic">Figure 4.30</em>), we can see that both layers have the<a id="_idIndexMarker242"/> keyframes within the same time. Both are starting at frame <strong class="bold">0</strong>, which is why the check icon is playing at the same time as the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong>.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer134" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_30.jpg" alt="Figure 4.30 – Keyframes position on the timeline&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.30 – Keyframes position on the timeline</p>
			<p>Remember that when we defined our storyboard, we decided <strong class="bold">check</strong> was going to be drawn after the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> was shown on screen. So, to do that, we need to adjust a couple of things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Unlock the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> layer.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> layer and press <em class="italic">S</em> to show the <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> property.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Let's check our keyframes on the Layer panel. We can see both animations are starting at frame <strong class="bold">0</strong>. Instead, based on our storyboard, the <strong class="bold">check</strong> animation should start once the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> is fully 100% on screen. That means, we need to move the <strong class="bold">check</strong> keyframes to the end of the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> animation. We can do that by selecting both the <strong class="bold">check</strong> keyframes and just dragging them to the right. You'll know both keyframes are selected as they both will be blue:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select both keyframes and drag them to the right.</li>
				<li>Press the spacebar and check the animation:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer135" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_31.jpg" alt="Figure 4.31 – Check keyframes&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.31 – Check keyframes</p>
			<p>Cool! Looks perfect to me now! However, it looks a bit slow, don't you think?</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Select the second <strong class="bold">check</strong> keyframe.</li>
				<li>Drag it to frame <strong class="bold">35</strong> approximately.</li>
				<li>Press<a id="_idIndexMarker243"/> the spacebar to play the animation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Perfect, we've got it! We are getting there. Now, we are going to add the sparks.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Working with radial bursts</h1>
			<p>To add some fun to <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>our animation, we are going to add little sparks coming out of <strong class="bold">Oval</strong>. To do that, we could animate each individual sparkle on its own, drawing little circles, and changing the <strong class="bold">Position</strong>, <strong class="bold">Scale</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong> values for each of them. However, we are going to try something different here. I'm going to teach you how to create a <strong class="bold">radial burst</strong>, a really cool effect that is going to save us a lot of time.</p>
			<p>So, let's do it! Let's start by creating a new composition by pressing <em class="italic"><img src="image/B17930_04_icon11.png" alt=""/></em> + <em class="italic">N</em> and naming it <strong class="source-inline">Sparks</strong>. We don't<a id="_idIndexMarker245"/> need to change any more settings.</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.35 – Circle layer Transform options</p>
			<p>For this effect, we are not going to use the <strong class="bold">Transform </strong>options we've been using up till now; instead, if we <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>want the radial burst effect to work, we are going to be working with the <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> options we can find inside the <strong class="bold">Contents </strong>option:</p>

			<p>While we are<a id="_idIndexMarker252"/> at it, let's make our circle fade out, so let's change <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Move the time slider to <strong class="bold">0</strong>.</li>
				<li>Create an <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong> keyframe.</li>
				<li>Move the time slider to <strong class="bold">30</strong>.</li>
				<li>Create a second <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong> keyframe.</li>
				<li>Set the <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong> property to <strong class="bold">0</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Good! Can you feel it? We are animating with no effort at all! Now, your timeline should look something like the one shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.40 – Timeline view of the Opacity keyframes</p>
			<p>Let's add <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>the magic:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Let's select <strong class="bold">circle</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Repeater</strong> option:</li>

				<li value="4">The <strong class="bold">Repeater 1</strong> layer<a id="_idIndexMarker254"/> will show up in our <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> menu, as you can see in the following screenshot:</li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.42 – Repeater 1 layer view in the Layer panel</p>
			<p>Let's open it up and<a id="_idIndexMarker255"/> see what's in there. As you can see in the following screenshot, we find new properties and values. As always, I encourage you to play around with the values here:</p>
			<div>

					<img src="image/B17930_04_43.jpg" alt="Figure 4.43 – The Repeater properties view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.43 – The Repeater properties view</p>
			<p>Let's continue. For our animation, I suggest you do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Change the <strong class="bold">Copies</strong> value to <strong class="bold">15</strong>.</li>
				<li>Open up <strong class="bold">Transform: Repeater 1</strong>.</li>
				<li>Set <strong class="bold">Position</strong> to <strong class="bold">0</strong>.</li>
				<li>Set <strong class="bold">Rotation</strong> to <strong class="bold">24</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>And then, press play!</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer150" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_44.jpg" alt="Figure 4.44 – Repeaters properties and transformations view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.44 – Repeaters properties and transformations view</p>
			<p>Isn't that<a id="_idIndexMarker256"/> cool? In just no time, we've created our version of sparks by just animating one circle. Imagine what we could do if we start adding some more elements!</p>
			<p>Now, let's go back to our main composition:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go to the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel.</li>
				<li>Double-click on the <strong class="bold">check</strong> icon.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Let's finish our animation:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Drag the <strong class="source-inline">Spark</strong> composition from the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel to the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel.</li>
				<li>Go to the timeline.</li>
				<li>Drag the <strong class="source-inline">Spark</strong> composition to the right, so that the animation starts at frame <strong class="bold">21</strong>. Our timeline will look like the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer151" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_45.jpg" alt="Figure 4.45 – View of the timeline of the Spark composition starting at frame 21&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.45 – View of the timeline of the Spark composition starting at frame 21</p>
			<p>Now, let's play <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>the animation! What do you think? I'm going to adjust <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> of <strong class="source-inline">Sparks</strong> a little bit; I'm going to change the value to <strong class="source-inline">110</strong>%. Let's do that and play it again. Nice! We are nearly done!</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer152" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_46.jpg" alt="Figure 4.46 – Radial burst effect&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.46 – Radial burst effect</p>
			<p>Good job! We've come a long way! In this last section, we've learned about and practiced so many new things. We got hands-on with our first animated icon. We now know how to create keyframes and change the property values to create the illusion of motion and animation. We know that by changing the layer's scale, rotation, position, and transparency, we can achieve great effects.</p>
			<p>We also learned two cool techniques that will save us a lot of effort when animating: Trim Paths and radial burst. We also applied some of the principles we learned in the first part of this book.</p>
			<p>But, before we <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/>move to exporting and handing off our animations, I want to show you the Ease effect I've been talking about in the last two chapters. So, let's move forward; let's discover Ease!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Adding ease</h1>
			<p>Now that we've got<a id="_idIndexMarker259"/> our animation up and running, let's nail it by adding some <strong class="bold">Ease</strong>. Remember the <strong class="bold">anticipation</strong> principle we talked about back in <em class="italic">Creating the illusion: Get Rolling with the Basic Principles of 2D Classic Animation</em>? That's what we can achieve with Ease: the perception of acceleration and slowing down with just one click. And, this little tweak is going to make our animation look much nicer, smoother, and professional. Here's how to do it:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open up the <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> layer to reveal its keyframes.</li>
				<li>Go to the timeline, right-click on the <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> keyframe <strong class="bold">0</strong>, and select <strong class="bold">Keyframe Assistant</strong> | <strong class="bold">Easy Ease Out</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer153" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_47.jpg" alt="Figure 4.47 – Right-click on the Keyframe menu view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.47 – Right-click on the Keyframe menu view</p>
			<p>Now, let's do the same with the last keyframe, the one placed at frame <strong class="bold">:1</strong>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go to the timeline, right-click on the <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> keyframe <strong class="bold">21</strong>, and select <strong class="bold">Keyframe Assistant</strong> | <strong class="bold">Easy Ease Out</strong>.</li>
				<li>For the second keyframe, the one placed at frame <strong class="bold">18</strong>, let's right-click on it and apply <strong class="bold">Easy Ease In</strong>, so your timeline should look as in <em class="italic">Figure 4.48</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer154" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_48.jpg" alt="Figure 4.48 – Representation of Keyframes with Ease In and Out applied&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.48 – Representation of Keyframes with Ease In and Out applied</p>
			<p>Let's check the <strong class="bold">Ease</strong> panel. Click <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>on the little icon from the timeline. From the graph, we can predict the velocity of the animation; it will accelerate exponentially at the beginning and slow down at the end.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer155" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_04_49.jpg" alt="Figure 4.49 – The Ease panel view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.49 – The Ease panel view</p>
			<p>Now, let's play our animation. What do you think? Can you tell the difference? I bet you can! Now, the animation looks smoother. But, before we move to do the same to the <strong class="bold">check</strong> layer, I suggest you play around with values and options. You know, learn by doing!</p>
			<p>Great! We've got our <strong class="bold">Oval</strong> looking quite cool, so now let's do the same with <strong class="bold">check</strong>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">check</strong> layer.</li>
				<li>Open the <strong class="bold">Contents</strong> layer.</li>
				<li>Open the <strong class="bold">Trim Paths</strong> layer.</li>
				<li>Right-click on the keyframe placed at frame <strong class="bold">21</strong>, the first frame of our <strong class="bold">check</strong> animation.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">Keyframe Assistant</strong> | <strong class="bold">Easy Ease</strong>.</li>
				<li>Do the same for the keyframe placed at frame <strong class="bold">35</strong>.</li>
				<li>Play the animation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It's getting there! Now, to<a id="_idIndexMarker261"/> finalize it, I'm going to do that in the <strong class="source-inline">spark</strong> composition as well:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go to the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel.</li>
				<li>Double-click on the <strong class="source-inline">spark</strong> composition.</li>
				<li>Select all keyframes.</li>
				<li>Apply <strong class="bold">Easy Ease</strong>.</li>
				<li>Go to the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel.</li>
				<li>Double-click on the <strong class="bold">check</strong> icon composition.</li>
				<li>Play it.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Our animation is done!</p>
			<p>As you've just experienced, Ease is a really powerful tool that will make your animations look stunning in no time. Of course, there is a lot more to learn about it; we've just gone through a couple of aspects of it so that you have the basic skills to learn further on your own.</p>
			<p>As we mentioned at the beginning of this book, we are not aiming to be an AE tutorial book; instead, we want to give you enough knowledge, background, and resources for you to start creating animations on your own, from concept to hand-off. So, I encourage you to explore and read more about Ease.</p>
			<p>If you don't know where to start, you know we've got you sorted, so just keep reading as, in <a href="B17930_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Don't Stop! Exploring Plugins and Resources That Will Keep You Going</em>, you'll find <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>more resources about Ease and much more!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>It wasn't that hard, was it? We've finished our first professional-looking animation in no time! Our customers won't feel confused after the purchase and our app will look much better. Win-win-win!</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we've been through a real project and learned the UX animation AE workflow. We have now covered the whole process, from ideation to final animation. We know how to read and understand storyboards, we've learned how to import our assets to AE, set up a composition, create keyframes, and modify layer properties such as <strong class="bold">Scale</strong>, <strong class="bold">Position</strong>, <strong class="bold">Rotation</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong> to create our animation. We've also learned how to use Trim Paths and radial bursts to create special effects, how to adjust timing, and how to apply Ease to finalize our project.</p>
			<p>Let's move on to the next chapter, where we will learn how to export our animation as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file and preview it on the LottieFiles platform. See you there!</p>
