It became popular because it threw away the HTML-centric way of developing web apps for JavaScript, which proved to be a remarkably developer-friendly way to develop web apps. With the help of this book, discover how you can take advantage of ReactJS to create web apps that are fun to code and easy to understand.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
