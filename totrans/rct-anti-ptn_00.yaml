- en: Building frontend applications is challenging, especially when constructing
    large ones, and the difficulty escalates without proper guidance. Unfortunately,
    many React-based applications fall into this scenario due to the library’s UI-centric
    nature, leaving developers to navigate the other complexities of frontend development
    on their own. There are numerous other considerations such as asynchronous network
    requests, accessibility, performance, and state management, to name a few. These
    factors contribute to the complexity of frontend applications. As the scale of
    the application grows, maintaining the code becomes an arduous task. Adding new
    features requires considerably more time than it first appears, and identifying
    defects (and then fixing them) is equally challenging, if not more so.

- en: However, these challenges are surmountable. We can learn to identify common
    anti-patterns that cause problems, then employ established patterns, design principles,
    and practices to address and rectify these issues. History teaches us that solutions
    derived in one field often find relevance in others, especially when it comes
    to fundamental design principles such as the Single Responsibility Principle,
    the Dependency Inversion Principle, and Don’t Repeat Yourself. These principles
    guided the construction of UNIX systems back in the 1970s and Java Swing applications
    in the 1990s, and they remain valid today. They will undoubtedly continue to be
    pertinent for future frameworks and libraries.

- en: This book seeks to delve into these problems and examine how established patterns
    and practices can mitigate the challenges of building large applications. We’ll
    see how design principles and design patterns can simplify the design, making
    the code easier to understand, modify, and maintain in the long run. Through this
    exploration, readers will gain a deeper understanding of how to navigate the multifaceted
    world of frontend development with React, ensuring their applications are both
    robust and maintainable.
