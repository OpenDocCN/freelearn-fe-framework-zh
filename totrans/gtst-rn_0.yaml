- en: Why are there so many alternatives to using native languages to write mobile
    apps? And, more importantly, why does the world need yet another approach? Obviously,
    there must be a problem that hasn't been solved.

- en: Developers want to use just one language to develop for both iOS and Android.
    Web developers want to reuse their existing JavaScript knowledge and leverage
    the web frameworks they already know and love. This is why Apache Cordova (PhoneGap)
    exists. By wrapping a web browser in a native app, developers can package their
    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript applications in a native shell, but why aren't all mobile
    applications based on Cordova?

- en: Users expect native performance, with a native user experience. Hybrid apps
    don't solve the user's problems, they solve the developer's problems. We need
    a technology that can do both!

- en: React Native changes the game with applications that are truly native. It doesn't
    use a WebView or transpile JavaScript to native languages. Think of it as native
    UI components being controlled by a JavaScript brain. The result is a user experience
    that is indistinguishable from any other native app, and a developer experience
    that leverages the amazing productivity benefits of JavaScript and the React framework.

- en: Armed with React Native, you'll finally be able to leverage your web development
    skills in the mobile world without sacrificing quality or performance. It's the
    Holy Grail, and we're excited to show you what React Native can do and to see
    what amazing apps you create with it!
