<p class="calibre2">The innovations in the JavaScript programming language in recent years have been vital. For example, since 2009 the rise of Node granted developers the ability to use the same programming language in the browser and on the backend. The environmental changes haven't slowed down in 2017 as well. This book will teach you about some new and hot concepts that speed up the full-stack development process even more.<br class="title-page-name"/>
In 2016 and 2017, there has been an even greater demand for making apps even faster with full-stack technologies such as Falcor or GraphQL. This book isn't just a guide on how to expose the API endpoints in Node and start consuming them with your client-side application. You will learn how to use the newest technology from Netflix, called Falcor. Beside that, you will learn how to set up a project with the use of React and Redux.<br class="title-page-name"/>
In this book, you will find a huge tutorial for building a full-stack app from scratch with the use of the Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Falcor, and Redux libraries. You will also learn how to deploy your application with the use of Docker and Amazon's AWS services.</p>
