    to larger sites. You will learn about how we can programmatically create pages
    using reusable templates and data sourced via GraphQL. By the end of this chapter,
    you will have created lists of blog posts, blog pages, and tag pages. You'll also
    understand how to introduce pagination and search functionality to your site.

- en: All the pages we have created up until now have been single instances, meaning
    there is only one copy of that page on the site (for example, our index page,
    of which there will be only one copy ever). But what happens when we consider
    pages such as blog pages? It would be a very laborious process to create a single
    instance page for each post. So, instead, we can use **templates**. A template
    is a multi-instance of a page component that is mapped to data. For every node
    in a GraphQL query, we can create a page using this template and populate it with
    the data of that node.

    pages dynamically. To ensure you can query all your data, this function is only
    run once all your data has been sourced. Inside this function, we first destructure
    the `actions` object to retrieve the `createPage` function. Then, we tell Gatsby
    where to find our blog post template. With these two pieces in place, we are now
    ready to query our data. You should see a familiar GraphQL query for selecting
    the `slug` from all the Markdown where the type is *Blog*. We then have a small
    `if` statement to catch errors but, assuming it's successful, we then have all
    the data we need to create pages. We can loop through the result of our data and
    loop through every data node, creating a page for each one by specifying a path
    (using `slug`) and our template. You'll also notice that we are defining some
    `context` here. Data that's defined in `context` is available in page queries
    as GraphQL variables, which will make it easy to map the correct Markdown content
    to the correct pages in the following steps. Restart your development server and
    open the development 404 page by navigating to any non-existent route on the port.
    This will display a list of pages on your site, including the pages we have just
    created. Clicking on one should render the static content we defined when creating
    the template. Now that these pages have been created successfully, let's navigate
    back to the template and modify it to retrieve the correct content instead of

    index using our `query` string. You will notice that we are passing in `expand:
    query.length > 2` as an option to the `search` function. This tells `elasticlunr`
    to allow partial matches if more than two characters have been entered. If you
    allow partial matches for fewer characters, you will often find that you get an
    abundance of results that are not related to what the user is looking for. Once
    we have searched the index, we can `map` over `documentStore` within `index` and
    return the document results, which are then passed to state via the `useState`
    hook.'

- en: We `map` over results from the state using the `results` value from the `useState`
    hook and render the results to the screen within our render function. For a slightly
    better user experience, it's often a good idea to include a `searchResultSize`
    constant. This value determines the maximum number of results to display. This
    stops cases where you have hundreds of results and see the overlay run off the
    page. Instead, if there are more results, we simply indicate to the user how many
    more results there are.

    server. You should see that the header of our site now contains our `Search` component.
    Try typing in a few characters and click on one of the results. You should be
    navigated to the corresponding page.

    here, we could add pages of different types to our results to create a true site-wide
    search.

    templates. You should feel confident that you can now create pages using any GraphQL
    data source. We've implemented a list of blog posts with pagination, blog pages,
    tag pages, and created a site search for blog posts that even works offline.

    First, we will learn why importing images is not that simple, before creating
    images that progressively load in and are performant.
