<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p>Building large-scale applications in production with React can be overwhelming with the number of choices and lack of cohesive resources. This hands-on guide is designed to share practices and examples to help address these challenges in building enterprise-ready applications <span class="No-Break">with React.</span></p>
<p>This book provides a concrete and practical example, developed throughout, to demonstrate the concepts in the book. You will learn how to build modern frontend applications from scratch that are ready for production. Beginning with getting an overview of the React ecosystem, you will identify the tools available to solve complex development challenges. You will learn how to build mocked APIs, components, and pages that form a complete frontend app. The book will also share practices for testing, securing, and packaging your app in a structured way. Finally, you will learn how to deploy your app to production with scalability <span class="No-Break">in mind.</span></p>
<p>By the end of the book, you will be able to efficiently build production-ready applications by following industry practices and <span class="No-Break">expert tips.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for intermediate-level web developers that already have a good understanding of JavaScript, React, and web development in general and want to build large-scale React applications effectively. Besides experience with JavaScript and React, some experience with TypeScript will <span class="No-Break">be beneficial.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B17297_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Architecture of React Applications</em>, teaches you how to think about applications from an architectural point of view. It starts by covering the importance of good architecture and its benefits. Then, it covers some bad and good practices in React applications. Finally, we will cover the planning of a real React application, which we will be building throughout <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>
<p><a href="B17297_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor033"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Setup and Project Structure Overview</em>, covers all the tools and setup for the application that we will be building. It will introduce us to tools such as Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and Lint Staged. Finally, it will cover the feature-based project structure for the project, which improves the code <span class="No-Break">base organization.</span></p>
<p><a href="B17297_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor049"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Building and Documenting Components</em>, introduces us to Chakra UI, a great component library that we will be using as building blocks for our UI. We will cover setting it up, and then we will build the components that we can reuse all over the application to make the UI of the application more consistent. Finally, we will learn about documenting those components <span class="No-Break">with Storybook.</span></p>
<p><a href="B17297_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor065"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Building and Configuring Pages</em>, covers Next.js in more depth. First, we will cover the basics, such as Next.js routing and the rendering strategies it supports. Then, we will learn how to handle shared layouts. Finally, we will apply those techniques by building the pages for <span class="No-Break">our application.</span></p>
<p><a href="B17297_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor084"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Mocking the API</em>, dives deep into mocking the API that can be used for development and testing. It starts by explaining why it is useful. Then, it introduces the MSW library, which allows mocking API endpoints in an elegant way. Finally, we will apply what we have learned by implementing the endpoints for <span class="No-Break">our application.</span></p>
<p><a href="B17297_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor098"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Integrating the API into the Application</em>, teaches us how to communicate with the backend API. We will learn how to configure the API client and React Query and use that to build the API layer for our application. Then, we will apply what we have learned by implementing the API calls for <span class="No-Break">our application.</span></p>
<p><a href="B17297_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing User Authentication and Global Notifications</em>, starts by teaching you how to implement the authentication for your application. Then, it demonstrates how to handle the global state by implementing the notifications system for <span class="No-Break">our application.</span></p>
<p><a href="B17297_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor127"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Testing</em>, teaches you how to approach testing a React application. It covers unit testing with Jest, integration testing with Jest and React Testing Library, and end-to-end testing <span class="No-Break">with Cypress.</span></p>
<p><a href="B17297_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor142"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Configuring CI/CD for Testing and Deployment</em>, covers the basics of a GitHub Actions pipeline. Then, we will learn how to configure the pipeline for code checking and testing. Finally, we will configure it for deployment <span class="No-Break">to Vercel.</span></p>
<p><a href="B17297_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor162"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Going Beyond</em>, touches on some uncovered topics. Since the application is at the MVP stage, there is room for improvement, and this chapter covers some of those improvements. We will also learn about some technical improvements that would help the application scale <span class="No-Break">even further.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>Previous experience with JavaScript and React and fundamental knowledge of web development will make it a lot easier to follow along with the content of the book. It is also desirable to have some experience with TypeScript and Next.js, but it should be possible to follow along without it since we will cover the basics in <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>
