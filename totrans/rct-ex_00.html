It aims to address the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. React's core principles are declarative code, efficiency, flexibility, and improved developer experience.</p><p>What better way of learning a new technology than diving deep into it while working on something? This book will guide you with the help of different projects, each focusing on the specific features of React in your journey of mastering React. We will cover everything from JSX, add-ons, performance, and Redux.</p><p>Let the journey commence!</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
