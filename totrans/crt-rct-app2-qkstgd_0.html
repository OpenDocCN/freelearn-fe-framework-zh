<p class="mce-root">Create React App is, in my mind, the ultimate example of a proper bootstrapping tool. Instead of the multiple hours of tedium getting everything tweaked and configured to be just right and hoping that you haven't missed anything along the way, you are instead given a tool and a project that is built and ready to go from the first minute you want to start embarking on your project. Now, the start up time to get moving on a project that is fully-featured goes from hours, or maybe even days, to minutes, and nothing is stopping you from building the React project of your dreams!</p>
<p>This book is intended for those that want to get intimately familiar with the Create React App tool. We'll cover all of the commands, all of the new additions in version 2, and we'll cover actually building a project from scratch and touching on all of the key concepts along the way to make sure you're able to take advantage of this tool to the absolute fullest!</p>
