- en: As Angular continues to reign as one of the top JavaScript frameworks, more
    developers are seeking out the best way to get started with this extraordinarily
    flexible and secure framework. *Learning Angular* , now in its fifth edition,
    will show you how you can use Angular to achieve cross-platform high performance
    with the latest web techniques, extensive integration with modern web standards,
    and **integrated development environments** ( **IDEs** ).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is especially useful for those new to Angular and will help you to
    get to grips with the bare bones of the framework needed to start developing Angular
    apps. You’ll learn how to develop apps by harnessing the power of the Angular
    **command-line interface** ( **CLI** ), write unit tests, style your apps by following
    the Material Design guidelines, and finally, build them for production.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Updated for Angular 19, this new edition covers lots of new features and practices
    that address the current frontend web development challenges. You’ll find new
    dedicated chapters on signals and optimization, as well as more on error handling
    and debugging in Angular, and new real-life examples. By the end of this book,
    you’ll not only be able to create Angular applications with TypeScript from scratch,
    but also enhance your coding skills with best practices.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we set up the development environment by installing the Angular
    CLI and learn how to use schematics (commands) to automate tasks such as code
    generation and application building. We create a new simple application using
    the Angular CLI and build it. We also learn about some of the most useful Angular
    tools that are available in Visual Studio Code.

- en: '*Chapter 2* , *Introduction to TypeScript*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we learn what TypeScript is, the language that is used when
    creating Angular applications, and what the most basic building blocks are, such
    as types and classes. We take a look at some of the advanced types available and
    the latest features of the language.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we learn how a component is connected to its template and use
    a decorator to configure it. We take a look at how components communicate with
    each other by passing data from one component to another using input and output
    bindings and learn about the different strategies to detect changes in a component.
    We also learn how to execute custom logic during the component lifecycle.

- en: '*Chapter 4* , *Enriching Applications Using Pipes and Directives*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we take a look at Angular’s built-in pipes and we build our
    own custom pipe. We learn how to create directives and leverage them through an
    Angular application that demonstrates their use.

    behind its use. We explore how to use signals for tracking the state of an Angular
    application. We also take a look at signals interoperability with RxJS and how
    they can play nicely together in a sample application.

- en: '*Chapter 9* , *Navigating through Applications with Routing*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we learn how to use the Angular router in order to activate
    different parts of an Angular application. We find out how to pass parameters
    through the URL and how to break an application into child routes that can be
    lazy loaded. We then learn how to guard against our components and how to prepare
    data prior to initialization of the component.
