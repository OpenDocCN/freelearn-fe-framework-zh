- en: AngularJS is a JavaScript development framework that makes building web applications
    easier. It is used today in millions of high-traffic web applications. Although,
    AngularJS served its purpose well over the past years web evolved and now the
    framework struggles with performance and scalability issues.

- en: In 2016, Google released **Angular**—a new framework for building scalable,
    performant application, inspired by AngularJS. This book allows you to align your
    work to the stable APIs of Angular, version 5 and beyond, with Angular expert
    *Minko Gechev*. With *Switching to Angular*, *Third Edition*, we will go through
    a journey that will help us utilize Google's long term vision for Angular in our
    future development. This books provides a detailed insight and knowledge to give
    us the clarity we need to confidently switch into the stable APIs of the framework.

- en: By the end of the book, you'll be able to align with Google's vision for Angular
    version 5 and beyond, with confidence. But primarily, you will learn how to build
    high-performance, scalable, and SEO-friendly enterprise applications with Angular
    and TypeScript.

- en: '[Chapter 1](53252869-31f5-4f60-b5c9-d349627db02a.xhtml), *Switching to the
    One Angular*, makes an introduction of what Angular is. You''ll learn that Angular
    and AngularJS are entirely different frameworks. After that, we''ll go through
    the basics of the structure of the framework—having a core with a minimalistic
    and immutable API, and building on top of it with different modules in order to
    provide the best development experience possible. Finally, we''ll see how Angular
    follows semantic versioning, which helps us understand why and when we should
    expect incompatible API changes in Angular.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ced71b5c-e25d-4781-8aab-81ef0a053b14.xhtml), *Get Going with Angular*,
    teaches why we should use the latest version of the JavaScript language, why to
    take advantage of web workers, and how Angular takes advantage of all these powerful
    technologies. We will observe the current direction of frontend development and
    the lessons learned in the past few years. The chapter describes why AngularJS''s
    architecture was changed in order to allow the development of SEO-friendly, high-performance,
    single-page applications.'

    of an Angular Application*, gives a quick overview of the main building blocks
    provided by Angular for the development of SPAs. We''ll point out the main differences
    with the core concepts from AngularJS.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](c8967e3c-a8b3-40c6-900e-e9ccd07357aa.xhtml), *TypeScript Crash
    Course*, introduces you to the TypeScript language that is used for the implementation
    of Angular. While exploring the language, we''ll look at some of the core features
    of ES2015 and ES2016\. We will explain the ES2015 and ES2016 classes, arrow functions,
    block scope variable definitions, destructuring, and modules. Since Angular takes
    advantage of the ES2016 decorators, and more accurately their extension in TypeScript,
    a section here speaks about them. After this, we''ll take a look at how we can
    take advantage of static typing using explicit type definitions. We''ll describe
    some of the built-in types in TypeScript and how we can define classes in the
    language by specifying access modifiers for their members. In the end, we''ll
    explain what structural typing is and how TypeScript''s type system takes advantage
    of it.'

    Angular Components and Directives*, takes us through the core building blocks
    of an Angular application: directives and components. We''ll build a couple of
    sample components to show us the syntax to be used for the definition of these
    fundamental building blocks. You''ll learn about the life cycle of each directive
    and the core set of features the given directive and component have. In the next
    step, we''ll see how we can enhance the performance of our application using Angular''s
    change detection strategies and immutable data structures.'

    in Angular,* covers the dependency injection (DI) mechanism of Angular. We''ll
    briefly discuss the positives of using DI in our projects by introducing it in
    the context of the framework. The second step in our journey is how to configure
    injectors using Angular modules; we''ll also explain the injectors hierarchy and
    the visibility of the registered providers. In order to enforce a better separation
    of concerns, we''ll take a look at how we can inject services carrying the business
    logic of our application in our directives and components.'

    Angular Router and Forms*, explains the basics of routing in Angular. We will
    take a look at how we can define different routes and implement the components
    associated with them that are displayed on route change. After that, we''ll explain
    how to develop template-driven forms with built-in and custom validation. Finally,
    we''ll explain how we can use two-way data-binding in Angular.'

    forms module by developing a model-driven (reactive) form, combining it with the
    HTTP module. We''ll take a look at some advanced features of the new component-based
    router and see how we can use and develop custom stateful and stateless pipes.'

    applications. Then, we''ll learn to build SEO-friendly applications with server-side
    rendering. After that, we''ll take a look at how to bootstrap a project as quickly
    as possible. Finally, we will learn what **Ahead-of-Time** (**AOT**) compilation
    is and how to use it.'
