			<p>React was built by Meta to provide more structure to its code base and allow it to scale much better. React worked so well for Facebook that they eventually made it open source. Today, React is the dominant technology for building the frontend of an application; it allows us to build small, isolated, and highly reusable components that can be composed together to create <span class="No-Break">complex frontends.</span></p>
			<p>TypeScript was built by Microsoft to help developers more easily develop large JavaScript-based programs. It is a superset of JavaScript that brings a rich type system to it. This type system helps developers to catch bugs early and allows tools to be created to robustly navigate and <span class="No-Break">refactor code.</span></p>
			<p>This book will teach you how to use both of these technologies to create large, sophisticated frontends that are easy <span class="No-Break">to maintain.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>If you are a developer who wants to create large and complex frontends with React and TypeScript, this book is for you. The book doesn’t assume you have any previous knowledge of React or TypeScript – however, basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS will help you get to grips with the <span class="No-Break">concepts covered.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B19051_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing React</em>, covers the fundamentals of building React components.
