- en: JHipster provides a platform for developers to easily create web applications
    and microservices from scratch, without having to spend a lot of time wiring everything
    together and integrating technologies together. This frees up time immensely for
    developers to actually focus on their solution rather than spending time learning
    and writing boilerplate code. JHipster will help novice and experienced developers
    to be more productive from day one. It's like pair programming with an entire
    community.

    You will learn to create complex production-ready Spring Boot and Angular web
    applications from scratch using JHipster and will go on to develop and deploy
    features and business logic on cloud services. You will also learn about microservices
    and how to convert a monolithic application into the microservice architecture
    as it evolves using JHipster. Additionally, you will learn how to make use of
    the new React support being introduced in JHipster and about various best practices
    and suggestions from the JHipster community and the core development team.
