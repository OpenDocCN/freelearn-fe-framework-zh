- en: Application errors are an integral part of the lifetime of a web application.
    They can occur either during runtime or while developing the application. Possible
    causes of a runtime error are an HTTP request that failed or an incomplete HTML
    form. A web application must handle runtime errors and mitigate unwanted effects
    to ensure a smooth user experience.

    language or framework according to its semantics. In this case, errors may override
    the compiler and surface in the application while running. Development errors
    can be mitigated by following best practices and recommended coding techniques.

    operator to simplify that. It can catch potential errors when initiating an HTTP
