<p>React may have opened up new frontiers for frontend web development and changed the way we program JavaScript user interfaces, but we still need a solid backend to build a complete web application. While there are myriad options when selecting backend technologies, the benefits and appeal of using a full JavaScript stack are undeniable, especially when there are robust and widely adopted backend technologies such as Node, Express, and MongoDB. Combining the potential of React with these industry-tested, server-side technologies creates a diverse array of possibilities when developing real-world web applications. This book guides you through Setting up <strong>MERN</strong> (short for <span><strong>MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js</strong>) </span>-based web development, to building real-world web applications of varying complexities.</p>
<p>Before diving into the development of these web applications, we are going to answer the following questions in this chapter, so you can use this book effectively to acquire full-stack development skills, and also understand the context behind choosing <span>the MERN stack to build your applications</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is new in the second edition?</li>
<li>How is this book organized to help master MERN?</li>
<li>What is the MERN stack?</li>
<li>Why is MERN relevant today?</li>
<li>When is MERN a good fit for developing web apps?</li>
</ul>

<p>MERN stack technologies along with the whole full-stack development ecosystem are continuously growing and improving with increased adoption and usage in the industry. In this edition, we take these new developments into account and update all the applications and corresponding code bases from the first edition.</p>
<p>We use the latest versions and conventions of each technology, library, and module needed for both development-related setup and feature implementations. Additionally, we highlight the use of new features from these technology upgrades such as React Hooks, and JavaScript features such as async/await. </p>
<p>In order to showcase even more possibilities with the MERN stack, we updated the existing marketplace application to add a more advanced feature such as real-time bidding. We also add two new projects, a web-based classroom application and an expense tracking application with data visualization features.</p>
<p>To better understand the content and concepts covered throughout the book, we expand on explanations and provide leads to the latest resources that may help you get a deeper grasp and improve your learning experience. </p>
<p>Besides covering the latest updates to MERN technologies and providing elaborate explanations, the concepts and projects in this book are organized to help you learn from easy to advanced topics with the flexibility to start at any project of your choosing. In the next section, we will discuss the structure of the book and how you can utilize it based on your preference and experience level.</p>

<p>The content in this book is practical-oriented and covers the implementation steps, code, and concepts relevant to building each MERN application. However, most of the code explanations will refer to specific snippets from files that may contain more lines of code, making up the complete and working application code.</p>
<p>Put simply, it is highly recommended that, rather than attempting to just read through the chapters, you should run the relevant code in parallel, and browse through the application features while following the explanations in the book.</p>
<p>Chapters that discuss code implementations will point to the GitHub repositories containing the complete code with instructions on how to run the code. You can pull the code, install it, and then run it before reading through the chapter:</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-760 image-border" src="assets/60f295d2-6475-4680-a746-96cac911a380.png" style="width:33.58em;height:20.67em;"/></p>
<p>You should consider the recommended steps outlined here to follow the implementations in this book:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before diving into the implementation details discussed in the chapter, pull the code from the relevant GitHub repository.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions with the code to install and run the application.</li>
<li>Browse the features of the running application while reading the feature descriptions in the relevant chapter.</li>
<li>With the code running in development mode and also open in the editor, refer to the steps and explanations in the book to get a deeper understanding of the implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p>This book aims to provide a quick onboarding with the working code for each application. You can experiment with, improve, and extend this code as desired. For an active learning experience, you are encouraged to refactor and modify the code while following the book. In some examples, the book chooses verbose code over succinct and cleaner code because it is easier to reason about for newcomers. In some other implementations, the book sticks with more widely used and traditional conventions over modern and upcoming JavaScript conventions. This is done to minimize disparity when you refer to online resources and documentation while researching the discussed technologies and concepts on your own. These instances, where the code in the book can be updated, serve as good opportunities to explore and grow skills beyond what is covered in the book.</p>
<p>You should now have an overall idea of what to expect in this book and how you can utilize its content and structure to the fullest as we move on to discussing the specifics of the MERN stack and start uncovering its potential.</p>

<p>MongoDB, Express, React, and Node are all used in tandem to build web applications and make up the MERN stack. In this lineup, Node and Express bind the web backend together, MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database, and React makes the frontend that the user sees and interacts with.</p>
<p>All four of these technologies are free, open source, cross-platform, and JavaScript-based, with extensive community and industry support. Each technology has a unique set of attributes, which, when integrated together, make a simple but effective full JavaScript stack for web development.</p>
<p>Since these are independent technologies, it is also important to recognize these as moving parts in your project that need to be configured, combined, and extended with additional parts to meet the specific requirements of your project. Even if you are not an expert in all the technologies in this stack, you need familiarity with each and an understanding of how these can work together.</p>

<p>Node was developed as a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node made it possible to start using JavaScript on the server side to build a variety of tools and applications beyond previous use cases that were limited to being within a browser.</p>
<p>Node has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous, non-blocking <strong>I/O</strong> (short for <strong>Input/Output</strong>). Its unique non-blocking I/O model eliminates the waiting approach to serving requests. This allows you to build scalable and lightweight real-time web applications that can efficiently handle many requests.</p>
<p>Node's default package management system, the Node Package Manager or <kbd>npm</kbd>, comes bundled with the Node installation. <kbd>npm</kbd> gives you access to hundreds of thousands of reusable Node packages built by developers all over the world and boasts that it is currently the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.</p>

<p>Express is a simple server-side web framework for building web applications with Node. It complements Node with a layer of rudimentary web application features that provide HTTP utility methods and middleware functionality.</p>
<div class="packt_tip packt_infobox">In general terms, <strong>middleware</strong><span> functionality in any application enables different components to be added on to work together. In the specific context of server-side web application frameworks, middleware </span>functions have access to the HTTP request-response pipeline, which means access to request-response objects and also the next middleware functions in the web application's request-response cycle.</div>
<p><span>In any web application developed with Node, Express can be used as an API routing and middleware web framework. </span>It is possible to insert almost any compatible middleware of your choice into the request handling chain, in almost any order, making Express very flexible to work with.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Find out what is possible with Express.js at <a href="http://expressjs.com/">expressjs.com</a>.</div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>In the MERN-based applications that we will develop, Express can be used to handle API routing on the server side, serve static files to the client, restrict access to resources with authentication integration, implement error handling, and, essentially, add on any middleware package that will extend the web application functionality as required.</p>
<p>A crucial functionality in any complete web application is the data storage system. The Express module does not define requirements or put restrictions on integrating databases with a Node-Express web application. Therefore, this gives you the flexibility to choose any database option, be it a relational database such as <span>PostgreSQL</span> or a NoSQL database such as MongoDB.</p>

<p>MongoDB is a top choice when deciding on a NoSQL database for any application. It is a document-oriented database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. This means that fields can vary from document to document and data models can evolve over time in response to changing application requirements.</p>
<p>Applications that place a high priority on availability and scalability benefit from MongoDB's distributed architecture features. It comes with built-in support for high availability, horizontal scaling using sharding, and multi-data center scalability across geographic distributions.</p>
<p>MongoDB has an expressive query language, enabling ad hoc queries, indexing for fast lookups, and real-time aggregation that provides powerful ways to access and analyze data while maintaining performance even when data size grows exponentially.</p>

<p>Choosing MongoDB as the database for a Node and Express web application will make a fully JavaScript-based and standalone server-side application. This will leave you with the option to integrate a client-side interface that may be built with a compatible frontend library such as React to complete the full-stack application.</p>

<p>React is a declarative and component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its declarative and modular nature makes it easy for developers to create and maintain reusable, interactive, and complex user interfaces.</p>
<p>Large applications that display a lot of changing data can be fast and responsive if built with React, as it takes care of efficiently updating and rendering just the right user interface components when specific data changes. React does this efficient rendering with its notable implementation of a virtual DOM, setting React apart from other web user interface libraries that handle page updates with expensive manipulations directly in the browser's DOM.</p>
<p>Developing user interfaces using React also forces frontend programmers to write well-reasoned, modular code that is reusable and easier to debug, test, and extend.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Take a look at the resources on React at <a href="https://reactjs.org/">https:/</a><a href="https://reactjs.org/">/</a><a href="https://reactjs.org/">reactjs.</a><a href="https://reactjs.org/">org/</a>.<a href="https://reactjs.org/"/></div>
<p>Since all four technologies are JavaScript-based, these are inherently optimized for integration. However, how these are actually put together in practice to form the MERN stack can vary based on application requirements and developer preferences, making MERN customizable and extensible to specific needs. Whether this stack is a relevant option for your next full-stack web project not only depends on how well it can meet your requirements, but also on how it is currently faring in the industry and where these technologies are headed.</p>

<p>JavaScript has come a long way since its inception, and it is ever-growing. MERN stack technologies have challenged the status quo and broken new ground for what is possible with JavaScript. But when it comes to developing real-world applications that need to be sustainable, is it a worthy choice? Some of the reasons that make a strong case for choosing MERN for your next web application are briefly outlined in the following sections.</p>

<p>Consistency across the stack also makes it easy to learn and work with MERN, reducing the overhead of adopting a new stack and the time to develop a working product. Once the working base of a MERN application is set up and a workflow established, it takes less effort to replicate, further develop, and extend any application.</p>

<p>Developer communities surrounding the very popular MERN stack technologies are quite diverse and are growing on a regular basis. With lots of people continuously using, fixing, updating, and willing to help grow these technologies, the support system will remain strong for the foreseeable future. These technologies will continue to be maintained, and resources are very likely to be available in terms of documentation, add-on libraries, and technical support.</p>
<p>The ease and benefits of using these technologies are already widely recognized. Because of the high-profile companies that continue adoption and adaptation, and the growing number of people contributing to the code bases, providing support, and creating resources, the technologies in the MERN stack will continue to be relevant for a long time to come.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>In order to determine whether this widely adopted stack will meet the specific requirements of your project, you can explore the extent of feature implementations possible with this group of technologies. In the next section, we will highlight a few aspects of this stack and also several features of the book's example applications that demonstrate the diverse array of options that are available with these technologies.</p>

<p>Given the unique features attributed to each technology, along with the ease of extending functionalities of this stack by integrating other technologies, the range of applications that can be built with this stack is actually quite vast.</p>
<p>These days, web applications are, by default, expected to be rich client apps that are immersive, interactive, and don't fall short on performance or availability. The grouping of MERN strengths makes it perfect for developing web applications that meet these very aspects and demands.</p>
<p>Moreover, novel and upcoming attributes of some of these technologies, such as low-level operation manipulation with Node, large file streaming capabilities with MongoDB GridFS, and VR features on the web using React 360, make it possible to build even more complex and unique applications with MERN.</p>
<p>It may seem reasonable to pick specific features in the MERN technologies and argue why they don't work for certain applications. However, given the versatile nature of how a MERN stack can come together and be extended, these concerns can be addressed in MERN on a case-by-case basis. In this book, we will demonstrate how to make such considerations when faced with specific requirements and demands in the application being built.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we discovered the context for developing web applications in the MERN stack and how this book will help you to develop with this stack. MERN stack projects integrate MongoDB, Express, React, and Node to build web applications. Each of the technologies in this stack has made relevant strides in the world of web development. These are widely adopted and continue to improve with the support of growing communities. It is possible to develop MERN applications with diverse requirements, ranging from everyday-use applications to more complex web experiences. The practical-oriented approach in this book can be used to grow MERN skills from basic to advanced, or for diving right into building more complex applications.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will start gearing up for MERN application development by learning how to set up the development environment with each MERN stack technology, and also write code for a MERN starter application to ensure the setup on your system is correct.</p>
