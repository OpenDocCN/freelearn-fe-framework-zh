- en: AngularJS is a JavaScript development framework that makes building web applications
    easier. It is used today in large-scale, high-traffic websites that struggle with
    performance and portability issues, as well as SEO unfriendliness and complexity
    at scale. The new version of Angular changes these.

- en: It is the modern framework you need to build performant and robust web applications.
    *Getting Started with Angular* is the quickest way to get to grips with Angular;
    it will help you transition into the brave new world of Angular 2 and beyond.

    Angular applications that take advantage of all the new features on offer.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Get Going with Angular"), *Get Going with
    Angular*, kicks off our journey into the world of Angular. It describes the main
    reasons behind the design decisions of the framework. We will look at the two
    main drivers behind the shape of the framework—the current state of the Web and
    the evolution of frontend development.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. The Building Blocks of an Angular Application"),
    *The Building Blocks of an Angular Application*, gives us an overview of the core
    concepts introduced by Angular 2\. We''ll explore how the foundational building
    blocks for the development of applications provided by AngularJS differ from the
    ones in the last major version of the framework.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. TypeScript Crash Course"), *TypeScript Crash
    Course*, explains that although Angular is language agnostic, Google''s recommendation
    is to take advantage of the static typing of TypeScript. In this chapter, you''ll
    learn all the essential syntax you need to know to develop Angular applications
    in TypeScript.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Getting Started with Angular Components and
    Directives"), *Getting Started with Angular Components and Directives*, describes
    the core building blocks for developing the user interface of our applications—directives
    and components. We will dive into concepts such as view encapsulation, content
    projection, inputs and outputs, change detection strategies, and more. We''ll
    discuss advanced topics, such as template references and speeding up our applications
    using immutable data.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Dependency Injection in Angular"), *Dependency
    Injection in Angular*, covers one of the most powerful features in the framework,
    which was initially introduced by AngularJS: its dependency injection mechanism.
    It allows us to write more maintainable, testable, and understandable code. By
    the end of this chapter, we will know how to define the business logic in services
    and glue them together with the UI through the DI mechanism. We will also look
    at some more advanced concepts, such as the injectors hierarchy, configuring providers,
    and more.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Working with the Angular Router and Forms"),
    *Working with the Angular Router and Forms*, explores the new module for managing
    forms in the process of developing a real-life application. We will also implement
    a page that shows the data entered through the form. In the end, we will glue
    the individual pages together into an application using the component-based router.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Explaining Pipes and Communicating with RESTful
    Services"), *Explaining Pipes and Communicating with RESTful Services*, dives
    into the router and the forms modules in detail. Here, we will explore how we
    can develop model-driven forms and define parameterized and child routes. We will
    also explain the HTTP module and take a look at how we can develop pure and impure
    pipes.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Tooling and Development Experience"), *Tooling
    and Development Experience*, explores some advanced topics in the Angular application
    development, such as Ahead-of-Time compilation, running an application in a Web
    Worker, and server-side rendering. In the second part of this chapter, we will
    explore tools that can ease our daily life as developers, such as angular-cli,
    angular-seed, and more.'
