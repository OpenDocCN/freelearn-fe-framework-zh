- en: Material-UI is the world's most popular React UI framework. It should come as
    no surprise that Material-UI skills are a valuable asset to have. There are countless
    projects in the open source space and in the commercial space that rely on this
    framework. So, what makes Material-UI so popular?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First and foremost, Material-UI does an excellent job of bringing together two
    of the best frontend technologies out there. In a nutshell, Material-UI exposes
    Google's Material Design as components in Facebook's React. Many developers know
    enough React to build something that works. Many designers know enough about Material
    Design to design an experience that looks incredible. Material-UI is the bridge
    between these two worlds, simplifying the task of shipping production applications
    that delight customers.

- en: At a high level, this sales pitch is enough to intrigue developers at every
    level and of every specialization. What keeps developers engaged with Material-UI
    is the breadth of functionality and the depth of resources available to help you
    tackle any scenario. My hope is that this book serves as a valuable contribution
    to those resources.

- en: This book is for any developer who thinks that Material-UI could potentially
    help them produce a better user experience for their application. From seasoned
    professionals to the junior developers of the world, this book has something to
    teach you about Material-UI.

- en: No Material Design knowledge is assumed. To get the most out of this book, you
    should have at least a working knowledge of React and modern JavaScript. While
    this book isn't meant to teach you React, I do try to explain the React-specific
    mechanism at work in cases where it might help illuminate the example as a whole.
