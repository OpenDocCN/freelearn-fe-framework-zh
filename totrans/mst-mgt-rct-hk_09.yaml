    everything is expected to be reusable. Global state is something that exists outside
    of components. It's often true that we should avoid using a global state where
    possible because it requires an extra dependency on a component. However, a global
    state is sometimes very handy and allows us to be more productive. For some app
    requirements, global state fits well.

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Global state tends to have multiple values. It's often the case that a component
    using a global state doesn't need all the values in it. If a component re-renders
    when a global state is changed but the changed values are not relevant to the
    component, it's an extra re-render. Extra re-renders are not desirable, and global
    state libraries should provide a solution for them. There are several approaches
    to avoiding extra re-renders, and we will discuss them in more detail in the *Optimizing
    re-renders* section.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book focuses on *global* state management; *general* state management is
    out of scope. In the field of general state management, popular approaches include
    the one-way data flow approach, as in Redux ([https://redux.js.org](https://redux.js.org)),
    and the state machine-based approach, as in XState ([https://xstate.js.org](https://xstate.js.org)).
    General state management approaches are useful not only for a global state but
    also for a local state.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Redux has been a big player in a global state management. Redux solves state
    management with one-way data flow with a global state in mind. However, Redux
    itself has nothing to do with React. It's React Redux ([https://react-redux.js.org](https://react-redux.js.org))
    that binds React and Redux. While Redux itself doesn't have a capability or a
    notion to avoid extra re-renders, React Redux has such a capability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because Redux and React Redux were so popular, some people overused them in
    the past. This was due to the lack of React Context before React 16.3, and there
    were no other popular options. Such people (mis-)used React Redux mainly for (legacy)
    Context, without needing the one-way data flow. With React Context since React
    16.3 and the `useContext` hook since React 16.8, we can easily solve use cases
    to avoid prop drilling and extra re-renders. That brings us to microstate management
    – our focus in this book.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you design an app, you may have a data model as a singleton in your app
    and you may already have the data to deal with. In this case, you would define
    components and connect the data and the components. The data can be changed from
    the outside, such as by other libraries or from other servers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the data-centric approach, module state would fit better, because module
    state resides in JavaScript memory outside React. Module state can exist before
    React starts rendering or even after all React components are unmounted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Global state libraries using the data-centric approach would provide APIs to
    create module state and to connect the module state to React components. Module
    state is usually wrapped in a `store` object, which has methods to access and
    update a `state` variable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Understanding the component-centric approach
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike the data-centric approach, with the component-centric approach, you can
    design components first. At some point, some components may need to access shared
    information. As we discussed in the *Effectively using local states* section in
    [*Chapter 2*](B17780_02_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor035), *Using Local and
    Global States*, we can lift state and pass it down with props (a.k.a. prop drilling).
    If prop drilling won't work as a solution, that's when we can introduce a global
    state. Certainly, we can start by designing a data model first, but in the component-centric
    approach, the data model is fairly tied to components.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the component-centric approach, component state, which holds a global state
    in the component lifecycle, fits better. This is because when all the corresponding
    components are unmounted, a global state is gone too. This capability allows us
    to have two or more global states that exist in JavaScript memory because they
    are in different component subtrees (or different portals).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Global state libraries using a data-centric approach provide a factory function
    to create functions that initialize a global state for use in React components.
    A factory function doesn't directly create a global state, but by using the generated
    functions, we let React handle a global state lifecycle.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    The data-centric approach and the component-centric approach are not really two
    sides of the same coin. In reality, you can use one of two approaches or a hybrid
    of the two approaches.

    module states for subtrees. You can even control the lifecycles of them.

    the provider component at the root of the tree and there's only one tree in JavaScript
    memory, it can be treated like a singleton pattern.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to have a mutable variable or `store`, an implementation with the `useRef` hook
    is possible. The implementation might be more complicated than using `useState`,
    but it still comes under the component lifecycle.

    to explicitly specify which part of a state is to be used in a component? There
    is something called state usage tracking, which is used to detect property access
    and use the detected information for render optimization.

    and `useTrackedState` only triggers re-renders when the `.b.c` property value
    is changed. This is automatic render optimization, whereas `useSelector` is manual
    render optimization.

    hook. If we were to write a selector, it would require memoization or a custom
    equality function, which are complicated techniques. However, if we use `useTrackedState`,
    it works without such complicated techniques.

    to trap the property access to the `state` object. If this is implemented properly,
    it can replace most use cases of `useSelector` and can do the automatic render
    optimization. However, there's a subtle case where the automatic render optimization
    doesn't work perfectly. Let's take a closer look in the next section.
