- en: '**Single Page Applications** (**SPA**) is a term used to refer to apps that
    are served from just one server route but have multiple client views. The single-server
    route is usually the default (`/` or `*`). Once the single-server route is loaded,
    the client (JavaScript) hijacks the page and starts controlling the route using
    the browser''s routing mechanisms.'
