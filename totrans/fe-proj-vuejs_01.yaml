    quickly with minimal impact on existing workflows or backend architecture. In
    many cases, the UI is overlooked completely until the end of a project, which
    can happen because of a lack of resources, ever-evolving product requirements,
    or the existing attitude that the frontend is the easy bit. However, companies
    such as Apple and Google have proven that design thinking on the frontend is key
    to a solid product or platform that will excite and engage users leading to a
    higher return on investment and a more successful business.

    that, at face value, solve the same problems such as Ember, Angular, or React.
    At the surface level, they all attempt to make reactive frontend development more
    reliable and introduce patterns that make this easier to do. However, there are
    some critical differences in how a Vue project might play out compared to an Angular
    or React project. Let's look into them.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Angular is a **Model-View-ViewModel** (**MVVM**) framework built by Google that,
    generally, enterprise companies in the past tended to favor because of Google's
    backing and the fact that from the ground up, Angular was created to be used alongside
    TypeScript. The ecosystem supporting Angular includes **Ahead of Time** (**AoT**)
    rendering, and router and CLI management, but fails to deliver a simplified global
    state management system; developers would need to learn and use **Flux** or adopt
    **NgRx**. Vue takes Angular's core ideas of robustness and reliability and improves
    the development experience with its agnostic approach to development by removing
    the restrictiveness of an enforced code style for developers. Simplifying familiar
    Angular patterns such as HTML directives and dependency injection for modularity
    with Vue's single-file component system benefits developers by removing the necessity
    to learn and remember a variety of structures (injectables, components, pipes,
    modules, and so on). Vue has excellent support for TypeScript and typing without
    the drawbacks that Angular can have with its enforced coding language and development
    style. React and Vue share a focus on component-driven development, which reduces
    the amount of time and effort needed to uptake a new framework.

    is attributed to Facebook's dedicated engineers and its 2013 open source release
    at a time when Angular 2+ was nowhere to be seen. React's JSX pattern (a way of
    writing HTML and CSS in JavaScript) introduces with it a heightened learning curve
    for new developers who are both required to learn another language and also wrap
    their heads around component-based architecture. Components allow developers to
    build applications in a modular way; individual components describe their own
    piece of functionality and lifecycle, where they can be instantiated when they
    are required and destroyed when they are not used. Vue takes these core concepts
    of modular coding and enables developers to build these components using either
    JSX or writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as you would a traditional web application
    in a single file. Vue's separation of concerns in a single-file component simplifies
    this modular structure for developers.

    CSS modules. Frontend development has always had to face the issue of conflicting
    CSS class names, ill-structured BEM code, and confusing CSS file structures. Vue
    components help to solve this by being modular and allowing you to compose CSS
    that, at compile time, will generate unique class names for the specific component
    that it was composed for. You can even have the exact same class names across
    components; however, they will be uniquely identified using a randomly generated
    string attached to the end.

    component styles and business rules do not risk overriding each other and do not

    directive `v-model` will reactively change when the bound data property that Vue

    When the key or the content bound to the key changes, Vue knows that it needs
    to reload the content inside the loop. If you have multiple loops in one component,
    randomize the key with extra characters or context-related strings to avoid `:key`

    logic that is executed. When you use JavaScript functions, normally, you would
    either return a value or simply perform a global action. The primary difference
    between writing functions and Vue methods is that the Vue method is scoped to
    your Vue component and can be run from anywhere inside the component it was written
    inside. Since the methods are scoped to your component's Vue instance, you can
    reference them inside of event directives easily in the HTML template. When binding
    events to HTML elements in Vue, you would use the `@` symbol; for example, `v-on:click`

- en: In this chapter, you have learned how to run a Vue project using the command
    prompt and to create basic Vue components. Within these Vue components, you can
    scaffold template that use Vue's unique directives and HTML syntax sugar to loop
    over data or control DOM states with conditional statements. Key concepts of reactive
    data through the use of data props and the `v-model` binding were explored and
    made useful in real-life examples that utilized Vue.js methods and lifecycles.
