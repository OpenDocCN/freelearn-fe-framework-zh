    encountered in React code bases, especially within large-scale React applications.
    We delved into potential remedies and techniques to rectify these issues. The
    examples throughout the narrative were drawn either from my prior projects or
    are related to domains with which developers are likely to be familiar – such
    as shopping carts, user profiles, and network requests, to name a few.

- en: I championed a step-by-step and incremental delivery approach, guiding you from
    an initial, less-than-ideal implementation toward a polished version, making one
    small improvement at a time. We embarked on organizing a typical React application,
    ventured into the realm of frontend testing through **test-driven development**
    (**TDD**), and initiated our journey with common refactoring techniques. Thereafter,
    we navigated the challenging waters of data/state management in React, elucidated
    common design principles, and explored compositional strategies. A slew of chapters
    were dedicated to constructing full examples from scratch, including a drop-down
    list, a shopping cart, and a weather application.

    network requests in both Cypress and Jest, apply the strategy design pattern to
    a JavaScript model, and employ **Anti-Corruption Layers** (**ACLs**) in real-world
    code scenarios.

    many are well established. However, their application in the React ecosystem has
    remained underexplored. I earnestly hope that this book has adeptly bridged that
    gap, reintroducing these invaluable design principles and patterns to the React
    community, thereby facilitating a smoother coding experience for developers in
    the long term.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Props drilling emerges when a prop traverses through multiple component levels,
    only to be employed in a deeper-level component, rendering intermediate components
    unnecessarily privy to this prop. This practice can lead to convoluted and hard-to-maintain
    code.

    of logic can become a behemoth, hard to understand, reuse, or maintain. This anti-pattern
    infringes upon the **Single Responsibility Principle** (**SRP**), which advocates
    that a component or module should only have one reason to change.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    component logic. HOCs are functions that accept a component and return a new component
    augmented with additional properties or behaviors. By leveraging HOCs, you can
    extract and share common behaviors across your components, aiding in mitigating
    issues such as props drilling and code duplications.'

    React components using a prop whose value is a function. It’s a method to pass
    a function as a prop to a component, and that function returns a React element.
    This pattern can be instrumental in alleviating issues such as long props lists
    and big components by promoting reuse and composition.

    the UI, bestowing the consumer with control over the rendering. They separate
    behavior logic from presentation logic, which can be a viable solution to business
    leakage and complicated logic in views, making components more flexible and maintainable.
