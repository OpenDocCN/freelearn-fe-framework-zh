- en: You're almost there—only one more chapter to go and then you can call yourself
    a React expert that has experienced React on every platform. Throughout this book,
    you've built nine applications with React and React Native. In this final chapter,
    we won't be creating a web or mobile application, but a **Virtual Reality** (**VR**)
    application with React and **three.js**. With three.js, you can create dynamic
    2D, 3D, and VR experiences using JavaScript, and with the use of another library
    apply it within React. Although VR is still an emerging technology, the best use
    cases for VR are, for example, retail stores that want their customers to experience
    their stores or games online.

    together with three.js and how it relates to React. The application you will build
    will be able to render 360-degree panorama images and use state management to
    render between screens. Animated 3D objects will also be displayed by combining
    React and three.js with other libraries.

    libraries. Previously, you could write VR applications in React directly with
    React 360\. But due to the emergence of other popular libraries, such as three.js,
    which is based on JavaScript, its development was discontinued. Three.js allows
    you to create applications with both 2D and 3D UI components without having to
    deal with complex setups for mobile or VR devices, which is similar to how React

- en: In this final chapter, you've combined all of the knowledge you have gathered
    from this book to create a VR application with React. We were able to do this
    by combining it with three.js, which is a JavaScript library for creating 3D applications.
    The project we created in this chapter serves a different and more niche use case
    than the other React projects in this book. It has basic animations, as well as
    a 3D helicopter object that flies away into the distance.

    created 10 projects with React and React Native. Now, you have a solid understanding
    of everything that you can do with React and how to use it across different platforms.
    While React and React Native are already mature libraries, new features are added
    continuously. Even as you finish reading this book, there will probably be new
    features you can check out. My main advice would be to never stop learning and
    keep a close eye on the documentation whenever a new feature is announced.
