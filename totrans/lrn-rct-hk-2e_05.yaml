- en: In this part, you will learn about various Hooks and how to use them. We start
    by covering the Reducer and Effect Hooks for managing application state. Then,
    we will cover React Contexts and data fetching using TanStack Query, React Hooks
    and React Suspense. Next, we will learn how to handle form submission with React
    form actions and the Action State Hook. We’ll continue by learning about using
    React Router and Hooks to handle various routing scenarios. Then, we’ll get an
    overview of all the built-in Hooks provided by React, learning about the advanced
    built-in Hooks that haven’t been covered yet in the other chapters. Finally, we’ll
    wrap up this part by using various Hooks provided by the React community, as well
    as learning where to find more useful Hooks.
