- en: Web applications built with Angular can be optimized for search engine optimization
    (SEO). Wikipedia defines SEO as "the process of affecting the online visibility
    of a website or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid results—often referred
    to as "natural", "organic", or "earned" results." Optimizing your app for search
    engines means your app is more visible on the internet and can drive more revenue
    for you or your client. Angular provides built-in features that can be leveraged
    to ensure our apps enjoy maximum visibility on the web.

- en: In this book, you will learn how to use Angular to create a progressive web
    app (PWA) that has great support for SEO. This learning journey begins by identifying
    what makes an app SEO friendly and installing Angular CLI. You will then build
    out the UI components and the application components. By the end of the first
    lesson, you will have an app ready that is built using Angular's best practices.
    In the remaining two lessons, you will implement server-side rendering and service
    workers in your app. You will create the server app, implement an Express server,
    and add dynamic metadata to your app. Finally, you will configure service workers
    and test the offline capabilities of your app.
