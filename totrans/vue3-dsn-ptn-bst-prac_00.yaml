  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vue 3 is the latest and most performant iteration of the “progressive framework”
    to create reactive and responsive user interfaces. The framework itself introduces
    new concepts and approaches to design patterns that could be uncommon in other
    libraries and frameworks. By learning the basics of the framework and understanding
    design principles and patterns from software engineering, this book helps you
    identify the trade-offs of each approach and build solid applications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It starts with basic concepts and then moves forward through examples and coding
    scenarios to build incrementally more complex architectures. You will start with
    a simple page and end with a multithreading, offline, and installable **Progressive
    Web Application** (**PWA**). The content also explores how to use the new test
    tools available for Vue 3.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Beyond showing you “how things are done,” this book helps you to learn how to
    “think” and “approach” common problems that design patterns have already found
    a solution for. Avoiding re-inventing the wheel with every project will save you
    time and make your software better suited for future changes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book targets Vue developers who care about framework design principles
    and utilize commonly found design patterns in web application development. Learn
    to use and configure the new bundler (Vite), Pinia (state management), Router
    4, web workers, and other technologies to create performant and solid applications.
    Prior knowledge of JavaScirpt and basic knowledge of Vue would be beneficial.
