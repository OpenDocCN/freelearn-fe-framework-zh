<p class="mce-root">There are a couple of ways to build, run, and start working with NativeScript applications.  We will cover command-line tools, as they are currently the most supported method, and the best way to do anything with any NativeScript project.  </p>
<p class="mce-root">To simplify things for our understanding, we will work through the commands that we will use frequently first, then we will cover the rest of the commands that aren't as frequently used. So, let's begin and work through the commands that you will want to know.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">The <kbd class="calibre11">tns run &lt;platform&gt;</kbd> command will automatically build your app and sync it up to the devices and emulators. It will do all the heavy-lifting to try and make your app be in a running state on the device, and then it will launch the app. This command has changed over the years and has now become a fairly smart command that will automatically make certain choices to simplify your development life. One of the cool features of this command is that it will sync your application to all running and connected devices. If you have five different devices hooked up, all five of them will receive the changes. This only works per each platform, but you can run <kbd class="calibre11">tns run ios</kbd> in one and <kbd class="calibre11">tns run android</kbd> in another command window, and then any changes will automatically be synced to all devices connected to your machine. As you may imagine, this is very useful during the testing and cleaning up phase to make sure that everything continues to look good on different phones and tablets. If you have no physical devices hooked up to your computer, it will automatically launch an emulator for you.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Normally, since the app already exists on the devices, it will just do a quick live sync of the changed files. This is a very fast process, as it just transfers all the changes in your files from your own <kbd class="calibre11">app</kbd> folder to all the connected devices, and then starts the app.  This process is, in the majority of situations, a really good thing. However, <kbd class="calibre11">tns run &lt;platform&gt;</kbd> will not always automatically detect any changes to your <kbd class="calibre11">node_modules</kbd> folder, for example, when you upgrade a plugin. If this is the case, you will need to cancel the current running <kbd class="calibre11">tns run</kbd> and then start a new <kbd class="calibre11">tns run</kbd>. Occasionally, the <kbd class="calibre11">tns run</kbd> will still believe that all it needs to do is sync, whereas the reality is that it should have to rebuild the app.  In this case, you will want to use the handy-dandy <kbd class="calibre11">--clean</kbd> option.  This is very important for times when the device does not seems to pick up any of your changes. The <kbd class="calibre11">tns run &lt;platform&gt; --clean</kbd> command will normally force the app to be rebuilt; however, if <kbd class="calibre11">--clean</kbd> fails to rebuild, then check out the <kbd class="calibre11">tns build</kbd> command described later in the chapter. There are a couple of other command parameters that aren't used much, but you might need them for a specific situation. The <kbd class="calibre11">--justlaunch</kbd> will start the app and do nothing else;  <kbd class="calibre11">--no-watch</kbd> will disable live syncing, and finally <kbd class="calibre11">--device &lt;device id&gt;</kbd> will force the app to be installed only on a specific device. You can view which devices are available for the installation of the app by running <kbd class="calibre11">tns devices</kbd>.</p>

<p class="mce-root">The next command we will discuss is <kbd class="calibre11">tns debug &lt;platform&gt;</kbd>; this will allow you to use the debug tools to test your application. This works in a similar way to the <kbd class="calibre11">tns run</kbd> command; however, instead of it just running your app, it will debug it. The debugger will use the standard Chrome development tools, which enables you to step through the code: break points, call stacks, and console logs. This command will give you a URL, which you can use to open in Chrome. In iOS specifically, you should run <kbd class="calibre11">tns debug ios --chrome</kbd> to get the URL for chrome-devtools. The following is an example of debugging Android via the Chrome debugger:</p>
<div class="mce-root1"><img class="image-border20" src="../images/00029.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="mce-root">Some of the same <kbd class="calibre11">tns run</kbd> parameters are valid here, such as <kbd class="calibre11">--no-watch</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre11">--device</kbd>, and <kbd class="calibre11">--clean</kbd>. In addition to those commands, several other commands are available, for example, <kbd class="calibre11">--debug-brk</kbd>, which is used to make the app break at the start of the application so that you can easily set breakpoints before continuing the start up process. <kbd class="calibre11">--start</kbd> and <kbd class="calibre11">--stop</kbd> allow you to attach and detach from an already running application. </p>
<div class="packt_tip">Don't forget that if you are currently using the debugger, JavaScript has the cool <kbd class="calibre29">debugger;</kbd> command, which will force an attached debugger to break just as though you had a breakpoint set.  This can be used to put a break anywhere in your code, and it is ignored if a debugger is not attached to your program.</div>

<p class="mce-root">The next command you will need to be aware of is <kbd class="calibre11">tns build &lt;platform&gt;</kbd>; this command fully builds a new app from scratch.  Now, the primary use for this command is when you want to build a debug or release version of the app you are going to give to somebody else to test or to upload it to one of the stores. However, it can also be used to force a fully clean build of the application, if the <kbd class="calibre11">tns run</kbd> version of your app is in a weird state--this will do a full rebuild. If you don't include the <kbd class="calibre11">--release</kbd> flag, the build will be the default debug build.  </p>
<p class="mce-root">On iOS, you will use <kbd class="calibre11">--for-device</kbd>, which will make the app compile for a real device rather than an emulator. Remember that you need to have signing keys from Apple to do a proper release build.</p>
<p class="mce-root">On Android, when you use <kbd class="calibre11">--release</kbd>, you will need to include all of the following <kbd class="calibre11">--key-store-*</kbd> parameters; these are required to sign in to your Android application:</p>
<table class="calibre32">
<tbody class="calibre5">
<tr class="calibre6">
<td class="calibre7"><kbd class="calibre33">--key-store-path</kbd></td>
<td class="calibre7">
<p class="mce-root">Where your key store file is located.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="calibre6">
<td class="calibre7"><kbd class="calibre33">--key-store-password</kbd></td>
<td class="calibre7">
<p class="mce-root">Your password to read any of the data in your keystore.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="calibre6">
<td class="calibre7"><kbd class="calibre33">--key-store-alias</kbd></td>
<td class="calibre7">
<p class="mce-root">The alias for this app. So, inside your keystore, you may have <kbd class="calibre11">AA</kbd> as the alias, which in your mind equals AwesomeApp. I prefer to make the alias the same as the full name of the app, but this is your choice.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="calibre6">
<td class="calibre7"><kbd class="calibre33">--key-store-alias-password</kbd></td>
<td class="calibre7">
<p class="mce-root">This is the password required to read the actual signing key assigned to the alias you just set.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="mce-root">Since keystores can be confusing to deal with, we will stray from the path slightly here and discuss how to actually create a keystore. This is normally only a one-time thing, that you will need to do for each Android application you want to release. This is also not something you need to worry about for iOS applications, as Apple provides you the signing keys, and they fully control them.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">On Android, you create your own application signing keys. As such, this key is used for the entire life of your application--by entire, I mean you use the same key to release every version of your application. This key is what links version 1.0 to v1.1 to v2.0. Without using the same key, the application will be considered a totally different application.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The reason there are two passwords is that your keystore can actually contain an unlimited number of keys, and so, each key in the keystore has its own password. Anyone who has access to this key can pretend to be you. This is helpful for building servers, but not so helpful if you lose them. You cannot change the key at a later time, so making backups of your keystore is extremely important. </p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Without your keystore, you will never be able to release a new version of the exact same application name, meaning that anyone using the older version will not see that you have an updated version. So, again, it is critical that you back up your keystore file.</div>

<p class="mce-root">If you use Google Play services, you might have to give them your Android application key fingerprint. To get your key fingerprint, you can use the following commands:</p>
<pre class="calibre22"><strong class="calibre1">keytool -list -v -keystore <em class="calibre21">&lt;keystore_name&gt;</em> -alias <em class="calibre21">&lt;alias_name&gt;</em>  -storepass <em class="calibre21">&lt;password&gt;</em> -keypass <em class="calibre21">&lt;password&gt;</em></strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root">You should see something like this:</p>

<p class="mce-root">Note that in addition to ensuring that you keep a good back up of your keystores, if you ever sell your application to another vendor, having separate keystores per application makes the transfer a lot easier and safer for you. If you use the same keystore and/or alias, it makes it difficult for you to separate out who gets what. So, for the sake of simplicity, I personally recommend that you have a separate keystore and alias per application. I normally keep the keystore in with the app and under version control. Since both opening and accessing an alias are password protected, you are fine unless you choose your passwords poorly.</p>

<p class="mce-root">This one is actually quite important, but it is only used when you want to deal with plugins. The most common version of this command is just <kbd class="calibre11">tns plugin add &lt;name&gt;</kbd>. So, for example, if you want to install a plugin called <em class="calibre21">NativeScript-Dom</em>, you will perform <kbd class="calibre11">tns plugin add nativescript-dom</kbd>, and it will automatically install the code for this plugin to be used in your application.  To remove this plugin, you would type <kbd class="calibre11">tns plugin remove nativescript-dom</kbd>. We also have <kbd class="calibre11">tns plugin update nativescript-dom</kbd> to remove the plugin and download and install the newest version of the plugin. Finally, running <kbd class="calibre11">tns plugin</kbd> alone will give you a list of plugins and their versions that you have installed:</p>
<div class="mce-root1"><img class="image-border22" src="../images/00030.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="mce-root">However, to be honest, if I need this information I'm looking for outdated plugins, and so your better bet is to type <kbd class="calibre11">npm outdated</kbd> and let <kbd class="calibre11">npm</kbd> give you the list of outdated plugins and the current versions:</p>
<div class="mce-root1"><img class="image-border23" src="../images/00031.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="cdpalignleft1">If you have outdated plugins, then you can use the <kbd class="calibre11">tns plugin update</kbd> command to upgrade them.</p>

<p class="mce-root">This one isn't used very much, but it is useful when you need it, as it allows you to install development plugins, such as webpack, typescript, coffee script, or SASS support. So, if you decide that you want to use <em class="calibre21">webpack</em>, you can type <kbd class="calibre11">tns install webpack</kbd>, and it will install the webpack support so that you can webpack your application.</p>

<p class="mce-root">This command is what we use to create a new project. This will create a new directory and install all the platform-independent code required to build a new app. The important parameters for this are <kbd class="calibre11">--ng</kbd>, which tells it to use the Angular template (which is what we are using in this book--without <kbd class="calibre11">--ng</kbd>, you get the plain JS template) and the <kbd class="calibre11">--appid</kbd>, which allows you to set your full app name. So, <kbd class="calibre11">tns create AwesomeApp --ng --appid com.mastertechapps.awesomeapp</kbd> will create a new Angular app in the <kbd class="calibre11">AwesomeApp</kbd> directory with the app ID, <kbd class="calibre11">com.mastertechapps.awesomeapp</kbd>.</p>

<p class="mce-root"><span>You can use t</span>he <kbd class="calibre11">tns platform</kbd> [<kbd class="calibre11">add</kbd>|<kbd class="calibre11">remove</kbd>|<kbd class="calibre11">clean</kbd>|<kbd class="calibre11">upgrade</kbd>] <kbd class="calibre11">&lt;platform&gt;</kbd> command to install, remove, or update the platform modules just like plugins. These are the <kbd class="calibre11">tns-android</kbd> and <kbd class="calibre11">tns-ios</kbd> modules you see listed in the prior <kbd class="calibre11">tns info</kbd> command. The application actually needs these platform-specific modules to be installed. By default, when you perform a <kbd class="calibre11">tns run</kbd>, it will automatically install them if they are missing. Occasionally, if the application refuses to build, you can use <kbd class="calibre11">tns platform clean &lt;platform&gt;</kbd>, and it will automatically uninstall and then re-install the platform which will reset the build process. </p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Note that when you do a <kbd class="calibre29">tns platform clean/remove/update</kbd>, these will totally delete the <kbd class="calibre29">platforms/&lt;platform&gt;</kbd> folder.  If you have made any manual changes to the files in this folder (which is not recommended), those changes will be deleted.</div>

<p class="mce-root">The <kbd class="calibre11">tns test &lt;platform&gt;</kbd> command allows you to install and/or start the testing framework. We will cover testing in more depth in later chapters, however, for the sake of completeness, we will cover the command in this section. <kbd class="calibre11">tns test init</kbd> will initialize the testing system; you will do <span>this</span> once per application. It will ask you to select a testing framework and then install your chosen testing framework. <kbd class="calibre11">tns test &lt;platform&gt;</kbd> will start the testing on that specific platform.</p>

<p class="mce-root">The <kbd class="calibre11">tns doctor</kbd> command checks your environment for common issues. It will attempt to detect whether everything is installed and configured correctly. It mostly works, but occasionally it will fail and state something is broken even when everything actually works. However, it provides a very good first indication of what might be wrong if your <kbd class="calibre11">tns run/build/debug</kbd> no longer works.</p>

<p class="mce-root">If you totally forget what we have written here, you can execute <kbd class="calibre11">tns help</kbd> which will give you an overview of the different commands. Some of the parameters may not be listed but at this point, they do exist. In newer versions, newer parameters and commands may be added to <kbd class="calibre11">tns</kbd>, and this is the easiest way to find out about them.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">If, for some reason, your app does not seem to be updating properly, the easiest way to fix this is to uninstall the app from the device. Then, try and do a <kbd class="calibre29">tns build &lt;platform&gt;</kbd>, then <kbd class="calibre29">tns run &lt;platform&gt;</kbd>.  If that fails to fix it, then uninstall the app again, do a <kbd class="calibre29">tns platform clean &lt;platform&gt;</kbd>, and then do your <kbd class="calibre29">tns run</kbd>. Occasionally, the platform may get in a weird state, and resetting it is the only way to fix the problem. </div>
