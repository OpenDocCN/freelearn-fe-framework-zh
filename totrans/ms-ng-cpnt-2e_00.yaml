- en: Web components have long been touted as the next great leap forward in web development.
    With the new version of the Angular framework, we're closer than ever. Over the
    past couple of years, there's been a lot of buzz around web components in the
    web development community. New component-style directives in Angular will change
    developers' workflows and their thinking about shared and reusable blocks of custom
    HTML in the shadow DOM. By building a whole application from scratch, this book
    is a practical way to learn, giving readers the chance to build components of
    their own. With *Mastering Angular Components*, learners will get ahead of the
    curve in a new wave of web development by focusing on an area that's the key to
    unlocking the powers of Angular development.

    way when developing user interfaces. This rich guide to the new component-centric
    way of doing things in Angular teaches readers how to invent, build, and manage
    shared and reusable components for their web projects. This book will change how
    developers think about how to accomplish things in Angular, and the reader will
    work on useful and fun example components throughout.'

    Interfaces*, looks at a bit of the history of UI development and provides a brief
    introduction to component-based user interfaces in general. We will see how Angular
    2 handles this concept.'

    gets the reader started on their journey toward building an Angular 2 component-based
    application. It covers the basic elements of structuring an application with components.'

    and State*, focuses on how to build a clean data and state architecture into our
    application. We''ll learn about reactive programming using RxJS, the pure component,
    the container component, and many more concepts, and tools that can be used to
    combat application state mess.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](1682edec-f2b3-4b02-afd8-ed7ef586b712.xhtml), *Thinking in Projects*,
    focuses on the structure of the user interface and its basic components. Readers
    will compose an application by organizing an application layout into components,
    establishing the composition of components, and creating a reusable tab component
    to structure the application interface. Readers will also build a re-usable editor
    component and a commenting system.'

    explains how components react to routing and enables readers to add simple routing
    to existing components in the task management application. Readers will also work
    on the login process and gain an understanding of how to protect components using
    the router.'
