<p>Deciding to learn Angular can be quite overwhelming. This is because the de facto way of writing an Angular app is by using a superset language, TypeScript, which is fairly new. Ironically, TypeScript simplifies how Angular apps are written by providing strict types (as seen in strictly typed languages such as Java), which improves the predictive behavior of the apps we write. This book is intended to assist you as a beginner/intermediate Angular developer with little or no knowledge of TypeScript or strict typing, in general, by explaining the core concepts of TypeScript.</p>

<p class="NormalPACKT"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><a href="dfb8cc54-b652-479b-8cf0-0ffa15ee3b0f.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, </span><em>From Loose Types to Strict Types</em>, discusses the problems developers faced before TypeScript was introduced, and what problems TypeScript solves. We will do this by discussing loose types and their challenges, and show some examples of how these challenges were being tackled previously and why TypeScript is a better choice.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><a href="1388eb32-f9cf-4efd-86fe-dc3f201ed039.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, </span><em>Getting Started with Typescript</em>, gives a summary of TypeScript's core concepts with practical examples on how to set up a vanilla JavaScript plus TypeScript project. All loosely typed examples in <span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><a href="dfb8cc54-b652-479b-8cf0-0ffa15ee3b0f.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, </span><em>From Loose Types to Strict Types</em>, will be rewritten with TypeScript to demonstrate TypeScript's efficiency.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><a href="fb2f2b0b-b55a-42c6-b7bc-6c1a275f064a.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Typescript Native Types and Features</em>, takes a deep dive into</span> built-in TypeScript strict types that match existing JavaScript loose types. Each type will be discussed extensively with working examples, showing how it should be used and how it should work.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><a href="466003d0-a079-4f5b-b8b5-8342eba35b82.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Up and Running with Angular and TypeScript</em>,</span> discusses how TypeScript applies to Angular. To do so, Angular needs to be up and running with the help of the CLI tool. In this chapter, we will discuss what it takes to have Angular and TypeScript work together. We will also cover the basic Angular concepts that you could find in a <em>Hello World</em> example.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><a href="1bef8c6c-8732-43d4-9844-b35b04fca6c0.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Advanced Custom Components with TypeScript</em>, d</span>iscusses the concept of web components and how Angular builds on web components with TypeScript. We will see how to create components with classes, implement lifecycle hooks with TypeScript interfaces, and define components, metadetails using TypeScript decorators.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><a href="70f76e99-3d5b-43d6-90ad-5ea049aa622c.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, </span><em>Component Composition with TypeScript</em>, discusses how Angular is component-based. It explains that components are composed together as building blocks to make a fully functional app. We will discuss modularizing components <span>using composition</span> with examples and component interaction (data transfer and events). In doing <span>so</span>, we will see how TypeScript is used to keep us in check with all these moving parts.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><a href="f6baa88b-3002-4e76-8073-06863d0cb16a.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Separating Concerns with Typed Services</em>, discusses how i</span>t’s bad practice to allow our logic to live in our components. In such a case, Angular allows you to provide API methods via services that these components can consume. We will discuss how TypeScript helps us create contracts (using types) between these API methods and the components.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><a href="1ac951ed-2cf7-4bb1-ad84-24cc0c915855.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Better Forms and Event Handling with TypeScript</em>, explains how t</span>he Angular form module enables us to write predictable typed forms with TypeScript, which is a perfect means of collecting data from our app users. We will also see how to use typed DOM events (for example, click, mouseover, and keydown) to respond to user interactions.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><a href="c6cff62e-09c2-4754-99e4-89e8dab27f8c.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Writing Modules, Directives, and Pipes with TypeScript</em>, d</span>iscusses the secondary building blocks of Angular and how they are best used with TypeScript. You will learn how to build custom directives and pipes in Angular with types and decorators.</p>
<p><a href="bbc0f13a-7758-469d-b16c-8af78e01f270.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Client-Side Routing for SPA,</em> explains Single Page Applications (SPAs), which are built by handing over routing to the client with JavaScript rather than the server. We will discuss how, with Angular and TypeScript, we can use the router module to build multiple view apps with just a single server route.</p>
<p><a href="e6f57cd1-4211-4636-beb0-aaec6fe9d596.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Working with Real Hosted Data</em>, takes a deep dive into consuming API data with Angular’s HTTP module. You will learn how to make an HTTP request right from our Angular app. Data fetched from this request can then be rendered by components.</p>
<p><a href="63371a6b-18cb-4834-838a-fd5a2af13944.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Testing and Debugging</em>, covers recommended practices on unit testing Angular building blocks. These include components, services, routes, and more.</p>

<p>This book is intended to assist a beginner/intermediate Angular developer with little or no knowledge about TypeScript or strict typing, in general, by explaining the core concepts of TypeScript. It’s also a perfect book for developers who have already worked with Angular 1.x or other frameworks and are trying to move to Angular 2.x.</p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "We can include other contexts through the use of the <kbd>include</kbd> directive."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>[default]<br/>exten =&gt; s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)<br/>exten =&gt; s,2,Voicemail(u100)<br/>exten =&gt; s,102,Voicemail(b100)<br/>exten =&gt; i,1,Voicemail(s0)</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>[default]<br/>exten =&gt; s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)<br/>exten =&gt; s,2,Voicemail(u100)<br/><strong>exten =&gt; s,102,Voicemail(b100)</strong><br/>exten =&gt; i,1,Voicemail(s0)</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong># cp /usr/src/asterisk-addons/configs/cdr_mysql.conf.sample</strong><br/><strong>/etc/asterisk/cdr_mysql.conf</strong></pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> button moves you to the next screen."</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p>
</div>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>
</div>
