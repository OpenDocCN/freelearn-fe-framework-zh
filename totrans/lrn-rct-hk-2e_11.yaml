    we can simply pass down the `dispatch` function instead of multiple setter functions.
  prefs: []

    safe to omit it from `useEffect` or the `useCallback` dependency arrays.

    an `initFn` function as the third argument. Specifying such a function makes sense

  prefs:

    a re-render. If this is needed, we can use a `ref` callback function instead.
    This function will be called when the element is loaded. We can use this, for
    example, to get the initial size of an element in the DOM. We can then set the
    state of a State Hook inside this callback function to trigger a re-render.
  prefs: []

    current width (even when the component is resized later), we need to use a **Layout

- en: For example, if you have a search where text can be entered to filter items,
    the Deferred Value Hook can be used to defer updates to the filter. Unlike debouncing,
    where we set a fixed time after which updates are persisted, deferring is dynamic
    and dependent on how fast the UI can be rendered. On faster machines, it will
    update more frequently, while on slower machines, updates will not slow down the
    rest of the UI.

    of the component. If no initial value is defined, the Hook will not defer during
    the initial render because there is no value that it can render until `value`
    gets set (for example, by the user typing into an input field).

    synchronously after all DOM mutations are completed and before the component is

    the appearance of components before rendering. Updates inside this Hook will be
    processed synchronously before the browser renders the component.
