    <p class="normal">Welcome to the wonderful world of Angular enterprise development! Standalone projects, signals, and the control flow syntax have injected fresh blood into the framework. At the time that this book is published, Angular 17.1 has been released with features to bring Signals-based components closer to reality, keeping the Angular ecosystem as vibrant as ever. If this trajectory holds, by Angular 20, the framework will be easier than ever to use and will make it possible to create reliable and high-performance applications of any size. This new edition of the book refocuses the content on enterprise architecture and continues the journey toward mastering sophisticated and scalable Angular solutions ready for complex business needs.</p>
    <p class="normal">Much like the previous edition, this book has been meticulously designed to equip you with indispensable knowledge and pragmatic examples so you can architect, build, and deliver robust Angular applications. The emphasis remains on adopting an efficient and minimalist approach – maximizing the capabilities of Angular itself and eschewing unnecessary dependencies. This results in streamlined code that is simpler to maintain as Angular continues its rapid pace of progress.</p>
    <p class="normal">The fundamental concepts you will learn from this book remain evergreen, even as tools and techniques continue to evolve. Router-first architecture, Angular components, the reactive programming model, the powerful routing system, and intuitive template syntax have stood the test of time. And they will provide you with a solid foundation as frameworks change and new versions emerge.</p>
    <p class="normal">This edition includes extensively expanded coverage of key topics like change detection, state management, decoupled components, modular design, router orchestration, and integration with backend systems. You’ll also learn crucial real-world skills for enterprise development, like user authentication, data validation, optimization best practices, and CI/CD pipelines.</p>
    <p class="normal">This definitive guide shares hard-won lessons on building web systems ready for the demands of any business. Over the years, the code and the content have been reviewed and improved by leading experts in the industry, and this edition is no different.
