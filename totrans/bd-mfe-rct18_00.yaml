- en: Microfrontends have emerged as a popular architectural pattern for building
    large, complex web applications by breaking them down into smaller, independent
    pieces that can be developed and deployed separately. This makes it easier to
    scale development, accelerate release velocity, and adopt new technologies incrementally.

- en: This book provides a comprehensive guide to implementing micro frontends in
    practice, from architectural principles and patterns to hands-on examples using
    frameworks such as React. You will learn how to divide a monolithic application
    into autonomous micro frontends. We will look at some of the key principles of
    micro frontends and scenarios where micro frontends may or may not be the right
    pattern.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will explore the different patterns of micro frontends and create micro frontends
    using module federation for client-side rendered apps and server-side rendered
    apps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will learn how to deal with things such as routing and state management when
    building micro frontends, and finally, we will learn how to deploy our micro frontends
    on Firebase and on a Kubernetes cluster using Azure.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for frontend and full stack developers aiming to build large, scalable
    web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks such as React. It will also
    benefit solution architects looking to adopt micro frontend architecture. You
    should have a good understanding of JavaScript, React, module bundling, and basic
    web development concepts.
