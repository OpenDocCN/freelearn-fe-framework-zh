- en: React Native is beginning to change the game in the mobile development world.
    Using the skills you already have, as a web developer, you can get a set of familiar
    methods to build user interfaces for mobile devices. In this book, we'll walk
    you through many React Natives features while developing a *note-taking* application,
    which we call **React Notes**. While building the essential features, such as
    creating notes, saving notes to the device, viewing a list of saved notes, and
    navigating between screens, you'll learn the fundamental skills you need to develop
    an app of your own. You'll also have the opportunity to go beyond the basics by
    adding the ability to store images and geolocation data with notes. Functionality
    is only a part of what makes a great app — it has to be great looking as well,
    so we've made sure to equip you with a thorough understanding of layout and styles.
    By the end of the book, you will have developed a fully featured application from
    start to finish and have all the skills you need to share your React Native applications
    with the world!

    that you'll learn how to build. We'll even point you in the right direction if
    you're anxious to start tinkering with the sample app to see what happens.

    you build, there are certain features that you''re very likely to have. Your UI
    will probably have multiple screens, so you''ll need the ability to navigate between
    them. In [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Beginning with the Example Application"),
    *Beginning with the Example Application* we will start laying the foundation for

    will demonstrate the value that React Native offers in rapid mobile development
    using the skills you have learned as a web developer.
