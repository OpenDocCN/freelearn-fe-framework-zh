- en: Hi again! Now that we have expanded our knowledge of 2D animation, gone through
    classic animation history, learned about its principles, and have our sketches
    and storyboard ready to go, let's move on. Let's talk about Adobe After Effects
    (AE).
  prefs: []

- en: So, why Adobe `.json` files, and this plugin was made for AE. These days, more
    and more integrations between Lottie and animation tools are being released, which
    is a good sign, as it shows how popular Lottie is becoming among animators, designers,
    and developers. Lottie for Adobe Animate is an example; however, most of them
    are still at an early stage and not all features are available yet, so we will
    keep our focus on AE for now.

- en: AE can be as simple or as complex as you want; from creating a small animated
    icon to a huge post-production cinema movie project, it is known as the industry-standard
    software for motion graphics and visual effects. Think of movie titles, explosions,
    logo animations, animated reels, and so on – a lot of these are made with AE.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, we are not pretending to run an exhaustive course in Adobe AE; there
    are fantastic books out there to do that. We talk briefly about AE, focusing on
    the animation aspects and providing you with the fundamental features and concepts
    to create your own animations, giving you enough resources so that you can keep
    learning at your own pace.

    the AE interface. By exploring some of its panels and menus, we are going to get
    deeper into the tools and features that are going to help us create our animations.

    the acceleration and deceleration of the ball make a lot more sense, and it looks
    more real. What now? We can add a **squash and stretch** effect.

    *Creating the Illusion: Get Rolling With the Basic Principles of 2D Classic Animation*,

    more realistic, we gave an example of a bouncing ball that stretches and expands
    along the way to give a more realistic effect.'

    it to a bouncing ball animation. If you want to see the final results, you can
    open the example provided with this book, `chapter03/` `AEbasics_bouncingball_squash_stretch`,
    to check how the animation is done and play around with keyframes, width, height,
    and also ease.

    until it hits the floor.

    what ease is and how it works. However, once you start getting familiar with it,
    you'll see that it is much better to create ease on your own directly in the **Graph
    Editor** panel. But at this stage, we are just going to be focusing on this, which
    is enough for us to make our animations look better and give us enough knowledge
    to keep us going and learning at our own pace.

    we've got to be practical here. There's no need to start learning every single
    tool, panel, action, or expression available in AE, as there are so many things
    we don't need to know for our Lottie animations. So, we wanted to keep it simple
    for you.

    panels, and got experience with real files with working with compositions, the
    timeline, and layers. We've been through layer properties, learned what the Parent
    & Link feature is and how to apply it to our layers, and learned how to create
    our first animation while explaining how to use keyframes to finally refine it,
    thanks to ease and the **Graph Editor** panel.

    what Lottie is, the principles of animation, and the basics of Adobe AE; we are
    now ready to move on to the second part of the book and perform some magic. Let's
    get started with our animated icon! I invite you to follow me to the next chapter.
