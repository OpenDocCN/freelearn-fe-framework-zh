- en: Welcome to the wonderful world of React Native apps! Thanks to this technology,
    you can have your own native app up and running in a matter of minutes. Don’t
    worry if this is the first time you are hearing about React Native. Basic knowledge
    of JavaScript will be enough to hit the ground running. Together, we will go over
    the important concepts of React and React Native and we will learn about the React
    Native ecosystem, setup, and tooling. By the end of [*Chapter 4*](B18396_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048),
    *Styling and Populating the Funbook App*, you will have a fully functioning social-media
    clone app in your hands.

- en: This is where stuff starts getting interesting. Our app has a few API endpoints
    and needs to manage data objects across multiple components and screens. This
    situation is very common in medium-sized and large applications. Because of this,
    there are many solutions to this common problem. A lot of developers use battle-tested
    and renowned open-source libraries, such as Redux or MobX. Others look for innovative
    ideas and land on XState or Jotai for their projects. Others still use built-in
    React functionalities or concentrate on data fetching instead of state management
    with the help of React Query. Throughout this book, we will put ourselves in the
    shoes of all of these types of developers. We will pick one specific functionality
    from the app – the like button with the list of liked images – and we will try
    out the open source libraries listed here, one by one.

- en: When we emerge victorious at the end of this book, you will have a very good
    understanding of different ways to manage states in React Native apps. I hope
    you will also have an idea of what you prefer, and why. Redux, MobX, XState, Jotai,
    and React Query were created to solve the same problem, but their creators approached
    it very differently. I also hope you will simply enjoy this book as much as I’ve
    enjoyed writing it.

    basic topics pertinent to software development with ReactJS. Even if you are knowledgeable
    about basic React solutions, you may be a newbie to MobX, XState, Jotai, or React
    Query, which means this book is meant for you as well.

    Native?*, will start by going over a brief history of web development to achieve
    a better understanding of the ideas behind the creation of React and React Native.
    We will also talk about ReactJS concepts, and we will get acquainted with React
    Native code.'

    We will concentrate on robust state management for medium-sized and large applications.
    Since React itself was not created with the tools to manage global states, we
    will look at modern React solutions and other state management strategies.'

    Funbook App*, will explore the tumultuous history of Redux and then go over configuring
    Redux and Redux Toolkit in the app. Once the dependencies are set up, we will
    move on to implementing the like button and the list of liked images with the
    help of Redux. This chapter includes responses from a short conversation I had
    with the main Redux and Redux Toolkit maintainer – Mark Erikson, also known by
    his Twitter handle `@acemarke`.'

    the mix. We will start with how this library came to be, and then move on to configuring
    it in the Funbook app. Once we’re ready, we will use it for the liked images list
    and the like button. This chapter includes responses from an exchange I had with

    very new way: maybe we don’t need state management libraries at all. Maybe all
    we must do is effectively manage data fetching. In order to test this hypothesis,
    we will install, configure, and use React Query, also known as TanStack Query.'
