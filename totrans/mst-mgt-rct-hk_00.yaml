- en: '*State management is one of the most complex concepts in React. Traditionally,
    developers have used monolithic state management solutions. Thanks to React Hooks,
    micro state management is something tuned for moving your application from a monolith
    to a microservice.*'

- en: '*This book provides a hands-on approach to the implementation of micro state
    management that will have you up and running and productive in no time. You''ll
    learn basic patterns for state management in React and understand how to overcome
    the challenges encountered when you need to make the state global. Later chapters
    will show you how slicing a state into pieces is the way to overcome limitations.
    Using hooks, you''ll see how you can easily reuse logic and have several solutions
    for specific domains, such as form state and server cache state. Finally, you''ll
    explore how to use libraries such as Zustand, Jotai, and Valtio to organize state
    and manage development efficiently.*'

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B17780_01_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor012), *What Is Micro
    State Management with React Hooks?*, explains how React Hooks help to deal with
    states. This allows us to have more purpose-specific solutions.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B17780_02_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor035), *Using Local
    and Global States*, discusses two types of states. Local states are often used
    and preferable. Global states are used to share states between multiple components.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B17780_03_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor049), *Sharing Component
    State with Context*, describes how Context is the primary method to deal with
    global states and how it works within React life cycles. We need some patterns
    to avoid extra re-renders.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B17780_04_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor066), *Sharing Module
    State with Subscription*, explains how module state is another method for global
    state. It works outside React life cycles. We need to connect the module state
    to React components, but a Subscription to the module state makes it easier to
    optimize re-renders.'

    State with Context and Subscription*, shows another approach for the global state
    by using both Context and Subscription. It works within React life cycles and
    avoids extra re-renders.'
