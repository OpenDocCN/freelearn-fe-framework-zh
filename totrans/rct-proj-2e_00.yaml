- en: This book will help you take your React knowledge to the next level by showing
    how to apply both basic and advanced React patterns to create cross-platform applications.
    The concepts of React are described in a way that's understandable to both new
    and experienced developers; no prior experience of React is required, although
    it would help.

- en: In each of the 10 chapters of this book, you'll create a project with React
    or React Native. The projects created in these chapters implement popular React
    features such as Hooks for re-using logic, the context API for state-management,
    and Suspense. Popular libraries, such as React Router and React Navigation, are
    used for routing, while the JavaScript testing framework React Testing Library
    and Cypress are used to write unit and integration tests for the applications.
    Also, some more advanced chapters involve a GraphQL server, and Expo is used to
    help you create React Native applications.
