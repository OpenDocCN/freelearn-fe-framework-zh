    of the loose-type nature of the JavaScript language. We also saw various attempts
    of mitigating these challenges, none of which felt natural at all. We also introduced
    TypeScript as a tool that could help; how TypeScript can help is what we will
    discuss in this chapter.

    and we need to treat them as such. Therefore, backed with hands-on examples, we
    will discuss these building blocks, how they work together, and how you can integrate
    them into your workflow as a JavaScript developer. But first, we need to learn
    how to set up TypeScript.

    editor as a property of the DOM and, hence, the error line. But wait, it is the
    same old JavaScript you have been writing your entire life. What's wrong here?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TypeScript comes with defined types for the DOM. This means that it will throw
    an error when we try to access a property that is not defined in the respective
    DOM interface (more on interfaces later). By nature, the DOM query method, `querySelector`,
    alongside the other query methods return an `Element` type (which is inferred
    if not annotated). The `Element` type is basic and is comprised of generic information
    about the DOM, which means that properties and methods specific to what is derived
    from `Element` will not be seen.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The input element is of the `HTMLInputElement` type. Because TypeScript infers
    the returned value as `Element`, we had to cast to the correct type, that is, `HTMLInputElement`.
    This is done by prefixing the returned value with `<>` and passing the interface
    that we want to cast it to.
  prefs:

- en: The messenger element is of the `HTMLElement` type. We still had to cast here
    using the same reason as seen in *Step 2* but with a different supported syntax

    properties/methods (such as `innerText`).

    invalid types.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Type annotation helps us write less verbose, more comprehensible, and bug-free
    applications. TypeScript makes annotation flexible; hence, you do not have to
    strictly provide types for every member in your logic. You're free to annotate
    what you feel is necessary, ranging from nothing to all; just keep in mind that
    the more strict your annotations are, the less debugging you will have to do in
    the browser.
