			<p>Are you looking to use Vue.js for web applications, but don't know where to begin? <em class="italic">Front-End Development Projects with Vue.js </em>will help build your development toolkit and get ready to tackle real-world web projects. You'll get to grips with the core concepts of this JavaScript framework with practical examples and activities.</p>
			<p>Through the use cases in this book, you'll discover how handle data in Vue components, define communication interfaces between components, and handle static and dynamic routing to control application flow. You'll get to grips with Vue CLI and Vue DevTools, and learn how to handle transition and animation effects to create an engaging user experience. In chapters on testing and deploying to the web, you'll gain the skills to start working like an experienced Vue developer and build professional apps that can be used by other people. </p>
			<p>You'll work on realistic projects that are presented as bitesize exercises and activities, allowing you to challenge yourself in an enjoyable and attainable way. These mini-projects include a chat interface, a messaging app, a shopping cart and price calculator, a to-do app, and a profile card generator for storing contact details.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you'll have the confidence to handle any web development project and tackle real-world front-end development problems. </p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Before You Begin</h2>
			<p>Every great journey begins with a humble step. Our upcoming adventure with Vue.js is no exception. Before we can do awesome things using Vue, we need to be prepared with a productive environment. In the following short sections, we shall see how to do that.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>Minimum Hardware Recommendations for Running Node.js Applications</h2>
			<p>To be able to run all the recommended tools used in the book, it's recommended that you have the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1 GHz or faster desktop processor</li>
				<li>512 MB of RAM (at a minimum; more is better)</li>
				<li>Windows 32/64 bit, macOS 64 bit, Linux ARMv7/v8</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Installing Node.js</h2>
			<p>Node.js is required to be installed on your computer in order for Vue.js to run. Download the latest LTS version by following the instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux at <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a>. Node.js is free to install and use.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Installing Git</h2>
			<p>Node.js applications use the version control tool Git to install extra tools and code. You can find the installation instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux at <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</a>. Git is free to install and use.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Installing Yarn</h2>
			<p>Some exercises will use the Yarn dependency manager to install and run Vue.js applications. You can find the instructions to download and install Yarn for Windows, macOS, and Linux at <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install">https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install</a>. Yarn is free to install and use.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-13"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>Installing Vue.js CLI (the Vue Command-Line Interface)</h2>
			<p>Some exercises will require you to use the Vue.js CLI. You can find the instructions to download and install the Vue.js CLI at <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html">https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html</a>. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-14"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>Installing Visual Studio Code (Editor/IDE)</h2>
			<p>You need something in which to write your Vue source code. This tool is called an editor or an <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>). If you already have an editor you like, you can use it with this book if you'd like to.</p>
			<p>If you don't already have an editor, we recommend you use the free Visual Studio Code editor. You can download the installer from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">https://code.visualstudio.com</a>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>After it is downloaded, open Visual Studio Code.</li>
				<li>From the top menu bar, select <strong class="source-inline">View</strong>.</li>
				<li>From the list of options, select <strong class="source-inline">Extensions</strong>. A panel should appear on the left side. At the top is a search input box.</li>
				<li>Type <strong class="source-inline">Vetur</strong>. The first option should be an extension called <strong class="source-inline">Vetur</strong> by <strong class="source-inline">Pine Wu</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="source-inline">Install</strong> button on that option. Wait for a message that says it's successfully installed.</li>
			</ol>
