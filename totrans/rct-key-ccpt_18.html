    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">
     With this book, you’ve gotten a thorough (re-)introduction to the key React concepts you must know in order to work with React successfully, providing both theoretical and practical guidance for components, props, state, context, React Hooks, routing, server-side React, and many other crucial concepts.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="normal">
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">
     But React is more than just a collection of concepts and ideas.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">
     It powers an entire ecosystem of third-party libraries that help with many common React-specific problems.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.3">
     There is also a huge React community that shares solutions for common problems or popular patterns.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="normal">
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">
     In this last, brief chapter, you’ll learn about some of the most important and popular third-party libraries you might want to explore.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">
     You will also be introduced to other great resources that help with learning React.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.3">
     In addition, this chapter will share some recommendations on how best to proceed and continue to grow as a React developer after finishing this book.

     How Should You Proceed?

   </h1>
   <p class="normal">
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">
     Use the knowledge you gained throughout this book as a foundation to build upon.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">
     Dive deeper into Next.js, explore other popular React libraries, or learn more about React alternatives like Angular or Vue.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">
     Web development offers a broad range of technologies, languages, libraries, patterns, and concepts.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.4">
     And while this can sometimes feel overwhelming, it’s also a vast pool of opportunities to grow as a developer and become better at solving complex problems.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="normal">
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">
     But besides learning more about React and related packages, it’s also important to apply your knowledge and practice what you’ve learned.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">
     Don’t just read book after book.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">
     Instead, use your newly gained skills to build some demo projects.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="normal">
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">
     You don’t have to build the next Amazon or TikTok.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">
     There’s a reason why applications like these are built by huge teams.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.3">
     But you should build small demo projects that focus on a couple of core problems.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.4">
     You could, for example, build a very basic website that allows users to store and view their daily goals, or build a basic Meetups page where visitors can organize and join meetup events.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="normal">
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">
     To put it simply: practice is key.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">
     You must apply what you’ve learned and build stuff.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">
     Because by building demo projects, you’ll automatically encounter problems that you’ll have to solve without a solution at hand.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">
     You’ll have to try out different approaches and search the internet for possible (partial) solutions.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.5">
     Ultimately, this is how you learn the most and how you develop your problem-solving skills.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="normal">
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">
     You won’t find a solution for all problems in this book, but this book does give you the basic tools and building blocks that will help you with those problems.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">
     Solutions are then built by combining these building blocks and by building upon the knowledge gathered throughout this book.

    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">
     You can find online shops for all kinds of products—ranging from physical goods such as books, clothing, or furniture to digital products such as video games or movies—and building such an online shop would be an interesting project idea and challenge.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="normal">
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">
     Of course, online shops do come with many features that can’t be built with client-side React alone.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">
     For example, the whole payment process is mostly a backend task where requests must be handled by servers.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">
     Inventory management would be another feature that takes place in databases and on servers, and not in the browsers of your website visitors.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4">
     Consequently, you can use Next.js (or one of the alternatives mentioned earlier in this chapter) to take care of this backend functionality and thus build a fullstack React application.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.5">
     But even if you don’t want to dive into fullstack development, online shops contain many features that require interactive user interfaces (and, therefore, benefit from using

     That backend would need to store user accounts in a database, validate login requests, and send back authentication tokens that inform the React frontend about the current authentication status of a user.
