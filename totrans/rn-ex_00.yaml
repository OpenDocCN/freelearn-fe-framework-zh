- en: React Native is an incredibly powerful framework that makes development on multiple
    platforms more accessible for web-centric programmers. In this book, you are going
    to learn how to build mobile applications using React Native that are ready to
    be deployed to both the iOS App Store and Google Play.

    a Basic To-Do List App*, begins the process of writing a to-do list application
    with React Native. You will plan the app and gain an overview of StyleSheet, Flexbox,
    and ES6\. You will also create the building blocks of the app with four different
    parts of the React Native SDK.'

    with the To-Do List App*, dives deeper into the app we started build in the first
    chapter. You will learn how to handle navigation, date and time selection, building
    buttons, and create a custom collapsible and animated component for use in the
    app. You will also take those lessons and translate them into an Android version
    of the app.'

    You will learn how to build a pull-to-refresh mechanism for the app, render images

    Native Components*, dives into parts of the React Native SDK that we were not
    able to fit into the rest of the book. In it, you will build a playground style
    app learning different parts of the SDK. You will grab data from any third-party
    endpoints, control the user’s vibration motor, open other installed apps with
    links in your app, and much more. You will also learn how to convert the budgeting
    app in the fourth chapter to Android, since space in that chapter was limited.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hardware-wise, you will need a Mac for this book. The content in this book is
    iOS-first, and to develop iOS apps you must have an Apple computer. Optionally,
    both an iOS and Android device would be helpful for testing apps on-device, but
    not mandatory. There is one API in the final chapter of the book that requires
    a physical device to test (Vibration), and another where testing would be easier
    on a physical device (Linking).
