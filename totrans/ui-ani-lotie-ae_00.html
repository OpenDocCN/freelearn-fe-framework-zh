			<p>Lottie is a small and scalable JSON-based animation file. LottieFiles is the platform where Lottie animations can be uploaded, tested, and shared. By combining the LottieFiles plugin and the LottieFiles platform, you'll be able to create stunning animations that are easy to integrate with any device. You'll also see how to use the Bodymovin plugin in Adobe <strong class="bold">After Effects</strong> (<strong class="bold">AE</strong>) to export your animation to a JSON file.</p>
			<p>The book starts by giving you an overview of Lottie and LottieFiles. As you keep reading, you'll understand the entire Lottie ecosystem and get hands-on with classic 2D animation principles. You'll also get a step-by-step guided tour to ideate, sketch for storytelling, design an icon that will fulfill the needs and expectations of users based on UX, and finally, animate it in AE. This will help you get familiar with the AE environment, work with vector shape layers, create and modify keyframes using layer properties, explore path, Parent &amp; Link features, and adjust timing easily to create professional-looking animations.</p>
			<p>By the end of this animation book, you'll be able to create and export your own Lottie animations using AE and implement them in mobile apps using React Native. You'll also have an understanding of 2D animation best practices and principles that you can apply to your own projects.</p>
