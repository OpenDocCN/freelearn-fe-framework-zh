- en: When a programming language is loosely typed, it means that the data passed
    around using variables, functions, or whatever member applicable to the language
    does *not* have a defined type. A variable *x* could be declared, but the kind
    of data it holds is never certain. Loosely typed languages are contrary to strongly
    typed languages, which enforce that every declared member must strictly define
    what sort of data it can hold.

    the line, this member could end up storing a number, a boolean, or even a data
    structure. This instability leads us to the implications of loosely typed languages.

- en: The variable `x`was initially declared and assigned a string value, `Hello`.
    The same `x` got re-assigned to a numeric value, `1`. Nothing went wrong; the
    code was interpreted and when we logged the value to the console, it logged the
    latest value of `x`, which is `1`.

    does not affect the execution. Everything works fine, and we have our expected
    result in the console.

    (variables, functions, and so on).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, what is the implication to take note of? The obvious implication is that
    the members that are loosely typed are inconsistent. Therefore, their value types
    can change, and this is something that you, the developer, will need to watch
    out for. There are challenges in doing so; let's talk about them.

    to work with--flexibility, as in giving you the freedom to change types anytime
    and anywhere, without the interpreter screaming errors like other strongly typed
    languages do. Just like any other form of freedom, this one also comes with a
    price.

    as an API without digging the code's source or documentation, there is a high
    possibility that he/she won't pass in the right value type. This is because *he/**she
    is blind*. Nothing tells him/her what is right and what is not. Even the name
    of the function is not obvious enough to make her pass in a string.

    true ([https://blog.simpleblend.net/is-everything-in-javascript-an-object/](https://blog.simpleblend.net/is-everything-in-javascript-an-object/)).
    There are *Objects* and there are *Primitives*. Strings, numbers, Boolean, null,
    undefined, are primitives but are handled as objects only during computation.
    That's why you can call something like `.trim()` on a string. Objects, arrays,
    dates, and regular expressions are valid objects. It's mind-troubling to say that
    an object is an object, but that is JavaScript for you.

    Remember that an array is an object. Therefore, we need something more specific
