- en: Building large-scale applications in production with React can be overwhelming
    with the number of choices and lack of cohesive resources. This hands-on guide
    is designed to share practices and examples to help address these challenges in
    building enterprise-ready applications with React.

- en: This book provides a concrete and practical example, developed throughout, to
    demonstrate the concepts in the book. You will learn how to build modern frontend
    applications from scratch that are ready for production. Beginning with getting
    an overview of the React ecosystem, you will identify the tools available to solve
    complex development challenges. You will learn how to build mocked APIs, components,
    and pages that form a complete frontend app. The book will also share practices
    for testing, securing, and packaging your app in a structured way. Finally, you
    will learn how to deploy your app to production with scalability in mind.

- en: This book is for intermediate-level web developers that already have a good
    understanding of JavaScript, React, and web development in general and want to
    build large-scale React applications effectively. Besides experience with JavaScript
    and React, some experience with TypeScript will be beneficial.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B17297_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014), *Understanding the Architecture
    of React Applications*, teaches you how to think about applications from an architectural
    point of view. It starts by covering the importance of good architecture and its
    benefits. Then, it covers some bad and good practices in React applications. Finally,
    we will cover the planning of a real React application, which we will be building
    throughout the book.'

    Overview*, covers all the tools and setup for the application that we will be
    building. It will introduce us to tools such as Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier,
    Husky, and Lint Staged. Finally, it will cover the feature-based project structure
    for the project, which improves the code base organization.'

    Components*, introduces us to Chakra UI, a great component library that we will
    be using as building blocks for our UI. We will cover setting it up, and then
    we will build the components that we can reuse all over the application to make
    the UI of the application more consistent. Finally, we will learn about documenting
    those components with Storybook.'

    Pages*, covers Next.js in more depth. First, we will cover the basics, such as
    Next.js routing and the rendering strategies it supports. Then, we will learn
    how to handle shared layouts. Finally, we will apply those techniques by building
    the pages for our application.'

    into mocking the API that can be used for development and testing. It starts by
    explaining why it is useful. Then, it introduces the MSW library, which allows
    mocking API endpoints in an elegant way. Finally, we will apply what we have learned
    by implementing the endpoints for our application.'

    the Application*, teaches us how to communicate with the backend API. We will
    learn how to configure the API client and React Query and use that to build the
    API layer for our application. Then, we will apply what we have learned by implementing
    the API calls for our application.'

    some uncovered topics. Since the application is at the MVP stage, there is room
    for improvement, and this chapter covers some of those improvements. We will also
    learn about some technical improvements that would help the application scale
    even further.'

    development will make it a lot easier to follow along with the content of the
    book. It is also desirable to have some experience with TypeScript and Next.js,
    but it should be possible to follow along without it since we will cover the basics
    in the book.
