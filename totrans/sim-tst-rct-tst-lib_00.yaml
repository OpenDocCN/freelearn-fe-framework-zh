- en: '**React Testing Library** (**RTL**) is a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for
    testing the **Document Object Model** (**DOM**) output of components. This book
    will show you how to utilize this modern, user-friendly tool to test React components,
    explaining its benefits to reduce risk in React applications.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book demonstrates code snippets that will allow you to implement RTL with
    ease, helping you understand the guiding principles of the DOM Testing Library
    to write tests from the user's perspective. You'll explore the advantages of testing
    components from the perspective of individuals who will actually use your components,
    and you'll use **Test-Driven Development** (**TDD**) to drive the process of writing
    tests. As you advance, you'll discover how to add RTL to React projects, test
    components using the Context API, and also learn how to write UI end-to-end tests
    using the popular Cypress library. Throughout this book, you'll work with practical
    examples and useful explanations to be able to confidently create tests that don't
    break when changes are made.
