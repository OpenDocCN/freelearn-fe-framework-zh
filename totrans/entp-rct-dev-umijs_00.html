			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>UmiJS is a scalable JavaScript framework for building enterprise-level frontend applications. Umi uses React and is based on a routing system that allows you to make fast and responsive applications.</p>
			<p>In this book, we will build a frontend web application for a <strong class="bold">customer relationship management</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRM</strong>) system. Starting with your environment setup, I will introduce you to the main features of UmiJS and how a project is structured. After that, we will explore Ant Design, a design system with a vast library of React components for quickly building modern and responsive user interfaces that deeply integrate with Umi.</p>
			<p>You will also learn an approach based on models and services to handle HTTP requests and responses and control an application's state in complex scenarios. </p>
			<p>After learning to work with Umi, you will explore how to improve code quality by implementing a consistent code style and using formatting tools such as Prettier and EditorConfig. You will also learn how to design and implement tests for frontend applications.</p>
			<p>Finally, you will host your CRM frontend application on AWS Amplify, an out-of-the-box platform for frontend developers to build full-stack applications using several AWS services.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for React developers who are new to UmiJS and building large web applications. I assume you already know React and the basics of designing web applications.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Conventions used</h1>
			<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Code in text</strong>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "In this example, we used the <strong class="source-inline">describe</strong> method to create a group for two tests related to math problems."</p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">export default {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  'home.recents': 'Recent opportunities',</p>
			<p class="source-code">  'greetings.hello': 'Hello',</p>
			<p class="source-code">  'greetings.welcome': 'welcome',</p>
			<p class="source-code">};</p>
			<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
			<p class="source-code">async function login(page: Page) {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  await page.goto('http://localhost:8000');</p>
			<p class="source-code">  <strong class="bold">await page.<a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>waitForNavigation();</strong></p>
			<p class="source-code">  await page.type('#username', 'john@doe.com');</p>
			<p class="source-code">  await page.type('#password', 'user');</p>
			<p class="source-code">  await page.click('#loginbtn');</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>

			<p class="source-code">yarn add -D puppeteer</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: "The <strong class="bold">Opportunities</strong> page allows users to browse and register a new sale opportunity."</p>
