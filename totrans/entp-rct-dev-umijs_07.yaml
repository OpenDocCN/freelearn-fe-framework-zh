    with large projects and multiple team members is to define a standard code style
    that every developer must follow. The code style should be discussed and documented
    so that every developer knows how to use it. This approach introduces other challenges,
    however, as we need to ensure that all developers follow the code style. Probably,
    you will end up reviewing the code to fix code style issues, which is a waste
    of time and money as it doesn't deliver value to the customer.

- en: EditorConfig consists of a format file and a set of plugins that ensure almost
    any IDE or editor follows the code style you have defined as you type. In some
    cases, you don't even need to install any extensions as various IDEs and editors
    come with native support for EditorConfig. You can read more about EditorConfig
    at [https://editorconfig.org/](https://editorconfig.org/).

    enforce the code style and consistency.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    style sheet extensions, markup languages, and configuration files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you know, we have been using Prettier since [*Chapter 1*](B18503_01_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014)*,
    Environment Setup and Introduction to UmiJS*. We configured VS Code to use Prettier
    to format the code on saving and pasting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our project, EditorConfig and Prettier share the responsibility to enforce
    the code style but with different approaches. While EditorConfig overrides the
    code style of the IDE or editor and ensures that the code is correctly formatted
    as you type, Prettier applies a standard code style after the developer types
    the code, replacing the styles with a standard code style defined by Prettier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When using Prettier, the developer doesn't need to worry about following a specific
    code style; they can focus on defining interfaces and developing business rules.
    Prettier will do the job of formatting the code with a consistent code style,
    and almost all debates about the team's code style are no longer necessary.

    In this option, we can override the options for specific files. Here, we configured
    Prettier to use the `JSON parser` specifically for the `.prettierrc` file.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The options you can set in `.prettierrc` are limited because Prettier enforces
    its standard code style. You can find other options in the Prettier documentation
    at [https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When using Prettier and EditorConfig in the same project, you need to avoid
    setting redundant options between these two tools. A good approach is to put only
    relevant options to override IDE and editor code style in the `.editorconfig`
    file and ensure that you are not repeating these options in the `.prettierrc`
    file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    different to the configurations in Prettier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prettier will parse the `.editorconfig` file to follow its configuration when
    formatting the code. As the IDE already formated the code by following the EditorConfig
    rules, Prettier can skip those rules and apply its own code style rules.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    rules in the `.editorconfig` file and Prettier by defining rules in the `.prettierrc`

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    In our scenario, where we use EditorConfig to override the IDE code style and
    Prettier to enforce a consistent code style by applying its own rules, we'll use
    only the code quality rules that ESLint offers. We could use only ESLint for code
    quality and formatting, but Prettier excels in code formatting and easily integrates
