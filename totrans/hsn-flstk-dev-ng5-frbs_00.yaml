- en: '*Hands-On Full Stack Development with Angular 5 and Firebase* will provide
    you with the practical knowledge you need to develop web applications. In this
    book, we have introduced all the major tools and technologies required to write
    a complete social media application. The book is written in such a fashion that
    you will build the application from scratch, and as you progress through the book,
    you will learn about the major concepts in web development. As part of our development
    process, this book religiously follows common software principles and coding standards.
    I have also introduced unit testing our Angular component, service, and pipe.
    These practices in software development make us better developers.'

- en: As a part of this book, we will build web application from development to production
    with Angular as the frontend and Firebase as the backend. Firebase is completely
    scalable and real time, providing all the tools needed to develop rich, collaborative
    applications. With Firebase, it's easy to build and prototype any business application
    without creating complex backend services.

    and CSS. Angular provides advanced features that modularize the client-side code
    into HTML, CSS, components, and services. As a part of our development, we will
    also integrate our application with other commonly used libraries, such as RxJS.
