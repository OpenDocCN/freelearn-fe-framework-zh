    wasn't always as easy as you would think. Back then, implementing animations used
    to be very time-consuming and would greatly increase the size of files. But then
    one day, Lottie was finally released, and light and color came into the world
    of animations, especially for mobile apps and websites.

    why we thought this would be the best way for you to learn how to create animations
    with Lottie. We don't want this book to be just another After Effects manual that
    teaches you how to animate an icon (of course, we will cover that too), but we
    think it is just as important to have the basics and be able to sketch your own
    ideas and bring them to life before opening any kind of software. You can jump
    straight to the chapter that matches your interests best, but we highly recommend
    going through the book from start to finish.

    adding some movement to a drawing by using some computer tools. It is the whole
    process that creates the magic, from ideation, the first sketches, to creating
    the illusion of movement through different animation techniques such as ease,
    tempo, and timeline keyframes. At some point, you might have thought why is this
    book talking about all this old-school stuff such as classic 2D animation?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it into After Effects, and converting it into Lottie so that you could implement
    it in your app using React Native in a very short period of time... Yes, that
    would have been the easiest and shortest part (and we will do that too, don't
    worry).

    animation, so when you finish reading this book, you will be able to think big

    animate, we will teach you the basics and give you enough resources and tools
    so that you can keep on learning in your own time and at your own pace.

    a first approach, we will go through Lottie; you will become familiar with the
    **Lottie** and **LottieFiles** keywords. While you keep reading, we will go into
    more depth about the entire Lottie ecosystem and will take a quick look at classic
    animation history.

    *Part 1*, *Building a Foundation With After Effects and LottieFiles*, we will
    be all set to start our first animation.

    of this book, we will guide you through a step-by-step tour of a real project
    to create our first unique animation. We are going to put into practice everything
    we have learned in the first three chapters. How? Well, we will start with a simple
    project in which we will be animating our first icon.

    this icon into Adobe After Effects and bring it to life by applying some of the
    2D animation techniques learned earlier in the book. By the end of *Part 2*, *Cracking
    Lottie Animations*, we will know the best way to export our animations and get
    them ready to hand off to developers.

    is so important. Let's imagine that you have spent a couple of days designing
    and creating your animation (yes, well done; animations are not quick things to
    do, at least, not the first time). You try to upload it into your app or the website
    of the app, but something goes wrong? Perhaps it doesn't look how it should or
    the animation in the app doesn't look the same as the one on the website. Maybe
    it is too heavy. Is it blurry? Is it responsive?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    panic. Here's where *Part 3*, *Adding Your Lottie Animations Into Mobile Apps*,
    comes in handy. That is where you will learn everything you need to know about
    how to test and implement your fabulous, stunning, and well-created Lottie animation
    onto any platform, simply and easily. Thanks to Lottie and React Native, your
    animation won't look pixelated, be too heavy, or do any other weird stuff.

    them onto your platforms using React Native, none of these issues will happen

    as it was meant to be.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The name **Lottie** was chosen as a tribute to *Charlotte "Lotte" Reiniger*,
    a German film director from the 20th century who became the foremost pioneer of
    silhouette animation. This is a technique based on cut-out figures that are moved
    frame by frame and filmed with a camera.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'After Apple decided Macromedia Flash wasn''t going near any iPod or iPhone,
    adding animations to our applications and websites became a nightmare. Animations
    had to be exported in low-quality formats; otherwise, developers had to recreate
    the code themselves. You can imagine how many of these ended up: the file sizes
    were too big, visualization was really poor, the process was painful, and the
    results were frustrating.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But then, in 2015, *Hernan Torrisi*, who had been working as an Action Script
    developer, came up with an idea. He started building a player and an exporter
    for After Effects, and this is where the **Bodymovin** plugin came to life. To
    be clear, the Bodymovin plugin transforms the animation into a JSON file, but
    we will talk about that later.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Torrisi also developed a browser-based renderer that takes the Bodymovin plugin's
    JSON files and plays back the animation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, when Airbnb engineers *Brandon Withrow* (on iOS), *Gabriel Peal* (on Android),
    and *Leland Richardson* (on React Native) realized the power of these JSON-based
    animations, they decided to partner with animator and experienced designer *Salih
    Abdul-Karim* to help develop Android, iOS, and React Native renderers for the
    Bodymovin plugin's JSON.

    *dotLottie*, and the *LottieFiles plugin* that can, sometimes, get a bit confusing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Essentially, Lottie is a library for iOS, Android, and React Native that will
    convert the animations that we will be creating in Adobe After Effects into lines
    of code. It does this very easily and without the need to write any code at all;
    we do it by simply installing an open source plugin into After Effects and pressing
    a button to render our animations and then exporting them as JSON. It's like magic,
    right?

    for iOS, Android, the web, and Windows. But today, it is commonly used to call
    the `.JSON` file that is exported from After Effects, which is also known as the
    animation file.

    Effects. There's no other way, or at least there wasn't until recently (keep reading).
    Anyhow, bear in mind that this is not a free tool. However, before purchasing

    has also released the LottieFiles plugin for After Effects, which exports your
    animation as a `.Lottie` file. The difference between Bodymovin and LottieFiles
    is the newly added features in the LottieFiles plugin. We will go into more depth
    on this once we talk about how to export your animations in both the Bodymovin
    and LottieFiles plugins.

    for any UX project. We also understood the meaning behind and the origins of Lottie.
    We discovered who *Hernan Torrisi* is and how Lottie is making the lives of designers
    and programmers easier. On the other hand, we now know the difference between
    Lottie and LottieFiles. Additionally, we've gone through the main features of
    the LottieFiles platform such as Editor, Viewer, Marketplace, and the library.
    They have all been set up with the main tools installed, so you are ready to start
    creating your own animations.
