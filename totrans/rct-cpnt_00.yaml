- en: React is a fascinating new take on traditional frontend development. It has
    taken the JavaScript community by storm and has inspired sweeping changes in a
    number of existing JavaScript application frameworks and architectures.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, there still aren't many examples of great architecture. Most
    tutorials and books focus on small components and examples, leaving the question
    of larger applications and component hierarchies unanswered. That is what this
    book seeks to change.
