It is used today in large-scale, high-traffic websites that struggle with performance and portability issues, as well as SEO unfriendliness and complexity at scale. The new version of Angular changes these.</p><p>It is the modern framework you need to build performant and robust web applications. <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with Angular</em></span> is the quickest way to get to grips with Angular; it will help you transition into the brave new world of Angular 2 and beyond.</p><p>By the end of the book, you'll be ready to start building quick and efficient Angular applications that take advantage of all the new features on offer.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf09lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Get Going with Angular">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Get Going with Angular</em></span>, kicks off our journey into the world of Angular. It describes the main reasons behind the design decisions of the framework. We will look at the two main drivers behind the shape of the framework—the current state of the Web and the evolution of frontend development.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. The Building Blocks of an Angular Application">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Building Blocks of an Angular Application</em></span>, gives us an overview of the core concepts introduced by Angular 2. We'll explore how the foundational building blocks for the development of applications provided by AngularJS differ from the ones in the last major version of the framework.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. TypeScript Crash Course">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>TypeScript Crash Course</em></span>, explains that although Angular is language agnostic, Google's recommendation is to take advantage of the static typing of TypeScript. In this chapter, you'll learn all the essential syntax you need to know to develop Angular applications in TypeScript.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Getting Started with Angular Components and Directives">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with Angular Components and Directives</em></span>, describes the core building blocks for developing the user interface of our applications—directives and components. We will dive into concepts such as view encapsulation, content projection, inputs and outputs, change detection strategies, and more. We'll discuss advanced topics, such as template references and speeding up our applications using immutable data.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Dependency Injection in Angular">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Dependency Injection in Angular</em></span>, covers one of the most powerful features in the framework, which was initially introduced by AngularJS: its dependency injection mechanism. It allows us to write more maintainable, testable, and understandable code. By the end of this chapter, we will know how to define the business logic in services and glue them together with the UI through the DI mechanism. We will also look at some more advanced concepts, such as the injectors hierarchy, configuring providers, and more.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Working with the Angular Router and Forms">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with the Angular Router and Forms</em></span>, explores the new module for managing forms in the process of developing a real-life application. We will also implement a page that shows the data entered through the form. In the end, we will glue the individual pages together into an application using the component-based router.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Explaining Pipes and Communicating with RESTful Services">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Explaining Pipes and Communicating with RESTful Services</em></span>, dives into the router and the forms modules in detail. Here, we will explore how we can develop model-driven forms and define parameterized and child routes. We will also explain the HTTP module and take a look at how we can develop pure and impure pipes.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Tooling and Development Experience">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Tooling and Development Experience</em></span>, explores some advanced topics in the Angular application development, such as Ahead-of-Time compilation, running an application in a Web Worker, and server-side rendering. In the second part of this chapter, we will explore tools that can ease our daily life as developers, such as angular-cli, angular-seed, and more.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf09lvl1sec2"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>All you need to work through most of the examples in this book is a simple text editor or an IDE, Node.js, an already installed TypeScript, Internet access, and a browser.</p><p>Each chapter introduces the software requirements for running the provided snippets.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf09lvl1sec3"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>Do you want to jump in at the deep end of Angular? Perhaps you're interested in assessing the changes before moving over? If so, then <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with Angular</em></span> is the book for you.
To get the most out of the book, you'll need to be familiar with AngularJS and have a good understanding of JavaScript. No knowledge of the changes made to Angular 2 and later versions is required to follow along.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf09lvl1sec4"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.
Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "You should see the same result, but without the <code class="literal">test.js</code> file stored on the disk."
A block of code is set as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">@Injectable()&#13;
class Socket {&#13;
 constructor(private buffer: Buffer) {}&#13;
}&#13;
&#13;
let injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([&#13;
  provide(BUFFER_SIZE, { useValue: 42 }),&#13;
  Buffer,&#13;
  Socket&#13;
]);&#13;
&#13;
injector.get(Socket);</pre><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><pre class="programlisting">let injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([&#13;
  provide(<span class="strong"><strong>BUFFER_SIZE</strong></span>, { useValue: 42 }),&#13;
  Buffer,&#13;
  Socket&#13;
]);</pre><p>Each code snippet that is in the repository with the code from this book starts with a comment with its corresponding file location:</p><pre class="programlisting">// ch5/ts/injector-basics/forward-ref.ts&#13;
&#13;
@Injectable()&#13;
class Socket {&#13;
  constructor(private buffer: Buffer) {…}&#13;
}</pre><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>New terms</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>important words</strong></span> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text surrounded by quotes, or like this: "When the markup is rendered onto the screen, all that the user will see is the label: <span class="strong"><strong>Loading….</strong></span>"</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note1"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip2"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
