- en: This book will provide the reader with a complete guide to test-driven development
    (TDD) focused on JavaScript and then dive into an Angular approach. It will provide
    clear, step-by-step examples to continually reinforce the best practices in TDD.
    This book will look at both unit testing with Karma and end-to-end testing with
    Protractor, and not only focus on how to use the tools but understand the reason
    they were built and why they should be used. Throughout, there will be a focus
    on when, where, and how to use these tools, constantly reinforcing the principles
    of the test-driven development life cycle (test, execute, and refactor).

    test-driven development by explaining why and how TDD can help in the development
    process.'

    of JavaScript Testing*, covers TDD in a JavaScript context. This chapter explores
    the types of tests that need in JavaScript applications, such as unit testing,
    behavior testing, integration testing, and E2E testing. This also explains different
    types of JavaScript testing tools, frameworks, and their uses in the Angular app.'

    the origins of Karma and why it has to be used in any Angular project. By the
    end of this chapter, readers will not only understand the problem that Karma solves but
    also will walk through a complete example using Karma.'

    Testing with Protractor*, takes a look at end-to-end testing applications, through
    all the layers of an application. This chapter introduced readers to Protractor,
    the end-to-end testing tool from the Angular team. Then it explained why Protractor
    was created and how it solve the problems. Finally, it guide the readers step
    by step how to install, configure, and use Protractor with TDD on an existing
    Angular project.'

    an introductory walk-through of how to use TDD to build an Angular application
    with classes, components, and services. This chapter helps readers to begin the
    TDD journey and see the fundamentals in action. Up to this point, this book stays
    focused on a foundation of TDD and the tools. And then, by going a step forward
    it dives into TDD with Angular.'

    our knowledge of applying TDD with Angular features such as routes and navigation
    to get the result set through our sample Angular application. Besides the Angular
    features, this also guides the readers how to apply end-to-end tests for those
    specific features with the help of Protractor.'

    make it more testable. And then it introduces to Angular services and event broadcasting
    while refactoring the code and introduce MockBackend to test HTTP requests in

    tool to run the application and various testing tools. So it's a prerequisite
    to have npm globally installed on your operating system. To install it, you must
    have Node.js installed on your operating system.
