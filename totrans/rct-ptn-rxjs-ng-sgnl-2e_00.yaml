- en: Embarking on the journey from imperative to reactive programming is a significant
    shift and one that I have experienced firsthand. As I navigated this transition,
    I found myself drawn to the world of reactive patterns and the transformative
    power they held. It was a journey filled with discovery, comparison, and a strong
    determination to understand this new way of thinking.

- en: Inspired by my own experiences, I’ve crafted this book to serve as a guide through
    the realms of reactive patterns within Angular applications. I believe that the
    reactive mindset is gradually achieved by comparing the reactive way to the imperative
    way, in order to distinguish the difference and benefits. Within these pages,
    you’ll discover how embracing reactive patterns can greatly enhance the way you
    manage data, write code, and react to user changes. From improving efficiency
    to creating cleaner, more manageable code bases, the benefits are vast and practical.
