    is a tiny library primarily designed to create module state for React. It's based
    on an immutable update model, in which state objects can't be modified but always
    have to be newly created. Render optimization is done manually using selectors.

- en: Zustand is a library that's used to create a `store` that holds a state. It's
    primarily designed for module state, which means you define this `store` in a
    module and export it. It's based on the immutable state model, in which you are
    not allowed to modify state object properties. Updating states must be done by
    creating new objects, while unmodified state objects must be reused. The benefit
    of the immutable state model is that you only need to check state object referential
    equality to know if there's any update; you don't have to check equality deeply.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    use all the properties in a global state. Let's learn how Zustand addresses this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To use `store` in React, we need a custom hook. Zustand's `create` function
    creates a `store` that can be used as a hook.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    `useStore` instead of `store`:'

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: 'Next, we must use the created `useStore` hook in React components. The `useStore`
    hook, if it''s invoked, returns the entire `state` object, including all its properties.
    For example, let''s define a component that shows the `count` value in `store`:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE10]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: This component shows the `count` value and that whenever the `store` state is
    changed, it will re-render. While this works fine of the time, if only the `text`
    value is changed and the `count` value is not changed, the component will output
    essentially the same `text` value causes extra re-renders.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that is, `useStore`. The previous component can be rewritten with a selector function,
    as follows:'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This selector-based extra re-render control is what we call **manual render
    optimization**. The way the selector works to avoid re-renders is to compare the
    results of what the selector function returns. You need to be careful when you're
    defining a selector function to return stable results to avoid re-renders.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    function creates a new array with a new object in it:'

    is fairly predictable because you explicitly write selector functions. However,
    the downside of selector-based render optimization is that it requires an understanding

    function properties. Note that it's a good convention to name the first argument
    `set`, which is short for `setState`.

    `inc2` function is just the result of `useStore`. Likewise, we could add more
    functions to `store`, which allows some logic to reside outside the components.
    You can co-locate state updating logic close to the state values. This is the
    reason why Zustand's `setState` merges old state and new state. We also discussed
    this in the *Understanding module state and immutable state* section, where we
    learned how `Object.assign` is used.

    re-rendering.

    addition to the React principle. It's a good recommendation if you need a library
    with a small bundle size, if you are familiar with referential equality and memoization,
    or you prefer manual render optimization.

- en: In this chapter, we learned about the Zustand library. It's a tiny library that
    uses module state in React. We looked at a counting example and a Todo example
    to grasp how to use the library. We typically use this library to understand object
    referential equality. You can choose this library or similar approaches based
    on your requirements and what you have learned in this chapter.

- en: We didn't discuss some aspects of Zustand in this chapter, including middleware,
    which allows you to give some features to the `store` creator, and non-module
    state usage, which creates a `store` in the React life cycle. These can be other
    considerations when you're choosing a library. You should always refer to the
    library documentation for more – and the latest – information.
