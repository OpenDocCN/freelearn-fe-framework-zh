Using the skills you already have, as a web developer, you can get a set of familiar methods to build user interfaces for mobile devices. In this book, we'll walk you through many React Natives features while developing a <span class="emphasis"><em>note-taking</em></span> application, which we call <a id="id0" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>React Notes</strong></span>. While building the essential features, such as creating notes, saving notes to the device, viewing a list of saved notes, and navigating between screens, you'll learn the fundamental skills you need to develop an app of your own. You'll also have the opportunity to go beyond the basics by adding the ability to store images and geolocation data with notes. Functionality is only a part of what makes a great app — it has to be great looking as well, so we've made sure to equip you with a thorough understanding of layout and styles. By the end of the book, you will have developed a fully featured application from start to finish and have all the skills you need to share your React Native applications with the world!</p><p>In this chapter, we'll introduce you to React Notes, the sample application that you'll learn how to build. We'll even point you in the right direction if you're anxious to start tinkering with the sample app to see what happens.</p><p>This chapter will focus on the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Installing Xcode on Mac OS X</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Running the sample application in the iOS simulator</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Taking a look at the sample application features</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"> Modifying the sample application</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Installing Xcode"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Installing Xcode</h1></div></div></div><p>Getting <a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>the tools to run the sample application is simple in OS X.

No matter what type of mobile application you build, there are certain features that you're very likely to have. Your UI will probably have multiple screens, so you'll need the ability to navigate between them. In <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Beginning with the Example Application">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Beginning with the Example Application</em></span> we will start laying the foundation for navigation and the note screen:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05162_01_05.jpg" alt="A sneak peek at the sample application"/></div><p>Not long after you <a id="id6" class="indexterm"/>have seen a bare-bones application, you'll want to start making it look good. Let us dive deep into styles and layout in <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Working with Styles and Layout">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Styles and Layout</em></span>, and carry those lessons throughout the rest of the book.</p><p>It's hard to imagine an application that doesn't have lists of data, and React Notes is no exception. We'll cover working with lists in <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Displaying and Saving Data">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Displaying and Saving Data</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05162_01_06.jpg" alt="A sneak peek at the sample application"/></div><p>One of the<a id="id7" class="indexterm"/> capabilities that sets mobile applications apart from web applications is the ability to access GPS data. We present capturing geolocation data using maps in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Working with Geolocation and Maps">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Geolocation and Maps</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05162_01_07.jpg" alt="A sneak peek at the sample application"/></div><p>It is very <a id="id8" class="indexterm"/>common to capture photos on mobile devices.
