- en: UmiJS is a scalable JavaScript framework for building enterprise-level frontend
    applications. Umi uses React and is based on a routing system that allows you
    to make fast and responsive applications.

- en: In this book, we will build a frontend web application for a **customer relationship
    management** (**CRM**) system. Starting with your environment setup, I will introduce
    you to the main features of UmiJS and how a project is structured. After that,
    we will explore Ant Design, a design system with a vast library of React components
    for quickly building modern and responsive user interfaces that deeply integrate
    with Umi.

    requests and responses and control an application's state in complex scenarios.

- en: After learning to work with Umi, you will explore how to improve code quality
    by implementing a consistent code style and using formatting tools such as Prettier
    and EditorConfig. You will also learn how to design and implement tests for frontend
    applications.

    platform for frontend developers to build full-stack applications using several
    AWS services.
