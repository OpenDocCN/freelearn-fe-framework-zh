- en: Web components have long been touted as the next great leap forward in web development.
    With Angular 2, we're closer than ever. Over the past couple of years, there's
    been a lot of buzz around web components for quite some time in the web development
    community. New component-style directives in Angular 2 will change developers'
    workflows and their thinking about shared and reusable blocks of custom HTML in
    the shadow DOM. Ours is the first book that guides developers along this path.
    It's also a practical way to learn, giving readers the chance to build components
    of their own. With *Mastering Angular 2 Components*, learners will get ahead of
    the curve in a new wave of web development by tightly focusing on an area that's
    the key to unlocking the powers of Angular development.

    rich guide to the new component-centric way of doing things in Angular teaches
    readers how to invent, build, and manage shared and reusable components for their
    web projects. This book will change how developers think about how to accomplish
    things in Angular 2, and the reader will be working on useful and fun example
    components throughout.'
