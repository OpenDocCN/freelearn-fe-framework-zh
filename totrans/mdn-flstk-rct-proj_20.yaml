- en: In this part, we will introduce **Next.js** as an enterprise-ready full-stack
    application framework. We will learn how it works and what its advantages are
    over using **React** alone. Then, we will create an app using Next.js and the
    new **App Router** paradigm. After that, we will introduce **React Server Components**
    and **Server Actions** as a way to directly interface with the database, without
    requiring a REST or GraphQL API. Then, we will dive deeper into the Next.js framework
    and learn about **caching**, **API routes**, adding metadata, and how to optimally
    load images and fonts. Next, we will learn how to deploy a Next.js app using **Vercel**
    and a custom deployment setup using **Docker**. Finally, we give an overview and
    briefly cover various advanced topics in full-stack development that have not
    been covered in this book yet. This includes concepts such as maintaining large-scale
    projects, optimizing the bundle size, an overview of UI libraries, and advanced
    state management solutions.
