    with a focus on technologies in the React ecosystem.

- en: In my time as a technical advisor and developer for enterprises and the public
    sector, I have noticed that more and more companies look to reduce the gap between
    frontend and backend developers. Their business requirements often result in the
    need for a so-called “backend for frontend,” where data is fetched from different
    backend systems and prepared in a way that can be easily displayed in the frontend.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an entrepreneur, I also have experience with starting new projects with smaller
    teams, where it is essential that every developer on your team can do everything,
    not just the frontend or the backend. In such cases, it often makes sense to develop
    the backend and frontend in the same language, which is often JavaScript (or TypeScript),
    because there is a big ecosystem and a large number of developers available.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In both cases, becoming a full-stack developer is getting increasingly more
    important. I have been coaching developers to learn more about full-stack development
    for a long time and have noticed that there are common issues and misunderstandings
    that most developers encounter when learning full-stack development. In this book,
    I want to summarize all my learnings and teachings about full-stack development,
    giving you pointers on where and how to learn more about the ever-growing ecosystem
    of full-stack development in JavaScript.

- en: Nowadays, many companies use a stack consisting of MongoDB, Express, React,
    and Node.js, called the MERN stack. In this book, I will teach you how to build
    modern full-stack React applications by using these technologies. I will teach
    these technologies from the ground up, using as few libraries as possible, so
    that you can learn the essential concepts. This will allow you to adapt to new
    technologies for years to come, even when the specific tools used in this book
    become outdated. Additionally, I will teach about the deployment of apps and DevOps,
    as I found that this sector is often neglected and there are not enough developers
    who know about it. In the last part of the book, I will introduce Next.js as a
    full-stack framework and give an outlook on new developments in this sector, such
    as React Server Components and Server Actions.
