    full-stack developer with a focus on technologies in the React ecosystem.

- en: 'In my time as a software development consultant and developer for enterprises
    and the public sector, I have observed a common challenge: developers often struggle
    with advanced React concepts due to a lack of in-depth understanding. Hooks in
    particular are a big source of confusion there. Often, it is hard to know what
    the best practices are and how to best structure and design an app with React
    and React Hooks.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, I want to teach you everything you need to know to build a modern
    and maintainable frontend with React. I will teach Hooks from the ground up, to
    ensure that you understand their limitations and where they shine. I will cover
    various common use cases that I have frequently encountered in my career – such
    as managing application state, when and how to use React Contexts, data fetching,
    form handling, and routing. I will also teach you when and how to build your own
    Hooks to keep your app maintainable and efficiently reuse logic across multiple
    components. In my opinion, custom Hooks are often underutilized in projects, but
    they can bring immense value, especially in larger projects.

- en: All of these concepts will be taught with practical examples so that you can
    immediately see them in action and start using them in your own projects. I sincerely
    hope you enjoy reading this book. If you have any questions or feedback, feel
    free to reach out to me!

- en: This book is for developers who already know how to work with React and want
    to learn how React Hooks and modern technologies related to them, such as form
    actions, Context, and Suspense, work in depth. Even if you already know about
    Hooks, this book will teach you how they work internally, so you can gain a deeper
    understanding of them. Additionally, you will learn some tips and tricks, as well
    as best practices on how to effectively develop React applications.
