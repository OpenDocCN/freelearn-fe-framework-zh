			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Chapter 3</em>: Learning the Tools: Getting Familiar With After Effects</h1>
			<p>Hi again! Now that we have expanded our knowledge of 2D animation, gone through classic animation history, learned about its principles, and have our sketches and storyboard ready to go, let's move on. Let's talk about Adobe After Effects (AE).</p>
			<p>So, why Adobe <strong class="bold">AE</strong>? Well, as you know by now, <strong class="bold">Bodymovin</strong> was the first plugin ever created to export animations into <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> files, and this plugin was made for AE. These days, more and more integrations between Lottie and animation tools are being released, which is a good sign, as it shows how popular Lottie is becoming among animators, designers, and developers. Lottie for Adobe Animate is an example; however, most of them are still at an early stage and not all features are available yet, so we will keep our focus on AE for now.</p>
			<p>AE can be as simple or as complex as you want; from creating a small animated icon to a huge post-production cinema movie project, it is known as the industry-standard software for motion graphics and visual effects. Think of movie titles, explosions, logo animations, animated reels, and so on – a lot of these are made with AE.</p>
			<p>However, we are not pretending to run an exhaustive course in Adobe AE; there are fantastic books out there to do that. We talk briefly about AE, focusing on the animation aspects and providing you with the fundamental features and concepts to create your own animations, giving you enough resources so that you can keep learning at your own pace.</p>
			<p>With that said, we are going to start this chapter by getting familiar with the AE interface. By exploring some of its panels and menus, we are going to get deeper into the tools and features that are going to help us create our animations.</p>
			<p>We will talk about compositions, how to create them, and their basic aspects. Also, we are going to learn how to move around the timeline and create frames and keyframes (which we already talked about in <a href="B17930_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating the Illusion: Get Rolling With the Basic Principles of 2D Classic Animation</em>) through menus and shortcuts. We will work with layers and their main properties, such as size, color, position, and transparency.</p>
			<p>We will look at animation techniques such as <strong class="bold">Parent</strong> and <strong class="bold">Link</strong> that will help us take our animations to the next level in the blink of an eye, and of course, we are going to get deeper into ease, learn how to work with ease in and ease out, and play around with the <strong class="bold">Ease</strong> panel to finally learn about the render settings to export our animation.</p>
			<p>So, by the end of this chapter, you will be able to move around your personally customized AE interface comfortably and be ready to start your first hands-on project – our supercool, to-be-animated icon!</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the Adobe AE environment</li>
				<li>Creating our own personalized work area</li>
				<li>What a composition is and its main specs</li>
				<li>Working with the timeline</li>
				<li>Layers and layer properties</li>
				<li>Animating using two different techniques – Parent and Link</li>
				<li>Ease – getting into more depth</li>
				<li>Rendering a window and how to set it up to render your animation</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to learn the basics of the Adobe AE working area, so before we start, you'll need to have installed the following tools:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adobe AE (if you need assistance on doing this, you can move forward to <a href="B17930_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Don't Stop! Exploring Plugins and Resources That Will Keep You Going</em>, where you'll find more information about the installation process)</li>
				<li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Getting to know the AE workspace</h1>
			<p>Before we start, we <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>are assuming you have already installed the Adobe AE software and the Bodymovin and LottieFile plugins, so we are ready to start. You can find a step by step installation guide ahead in <a href="B17930_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Don't Stop! Exploring Plugins and Resources That Will Keep You Going</em>. So, if you haven't installed your plugins yet, now is the time to do it.</p>
			<p>Cool, so are you all set and ready to go? Let's do it then:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Let's open up AE and click on the <strong class="bold">Create a New Project</strong> button. So, what we can see here, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.1</em>, is AE's standard workspace organized by a variety of panels and windows.</li>
				<li>For our animation projects, we are going to focus on the <strong class="bold">Project</strong>, <strong class="bold">Composition</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Layers</strong> and <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> panels, so let's set up our workspace.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer057" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_01.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – The Adobe AE workspace&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1 – The Adobe AE workspace</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Customizing our workspace</h2>
			<p>AE offers a <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>flexible space with tools and windows that we can manage and organize as we need. We can drag the panels by their tabs and drop them somewhere else on the screen or in and out of a group, and open new windows or close them down.</p>
			<p>I would recommend organizing your workspace by keeping open three panels, <strong class="bold">Project</strong>, <strong class="bold">Composition</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Layers and Timeline</strong>, for now:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer058" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_02.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – The Project, Composition, and Layers and Timeline panels&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2 – The Project, Composition, and Layers and Timeline panels</p>
			<p>You can always <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>save your new panel settings by selecting the <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong> | <strong class="bold">Save as New Workspace…</strong> option in the top bar menu:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer059" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_03.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – Save as New Workspace…&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – Save as New Workspace…</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Project panel</h2>
			<p>Now that our <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>workspace is all set, let's learn more about the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel. It will be brief, but what's important to mention is that the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel is like a library where we are going to import and organize our files and where our compositions are going to be kept.</p>
			<p>As you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 3.4</em>, the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel shows three files:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer060" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_04.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – The Project panel &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4 – The Project panel </p>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel, we<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> can also see a few details about the files, such as the size, duration, and frame rate as well as the type of file – in this case, <strong class="bold">Composition</strong>. Don't worry if you don't understand what that means; we will discuss it next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Understanding compositions</h2>
			<p>The first thing<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> to learn about AE is <strong class="bold">compositions</strong>. Imagine them as<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> containers of space and time, which means that anything we add to a composition, such as graphics, animations, sounds, and effects, will be kept as different layers and shown in the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> panel, as you can see in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer061" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_05.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5 – Layers of a composition named Comp 1 in the Timeline panel&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5 – Layers of a composition named Comp 1 in the Timeline panel</p>
			<p>A project <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>can have as many compositions as we need, and they can be nested as well. Does it sound a bit confusing to you? Don't worry – I'll give you an example.</p>
			<p>Remember the<a id="_idIndexMarker108"/> files showing in our <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel? Imagine that we've got to animate a bouncing ball over a background. The ball is going to move up and down in the middle of the screen, and the background is going to move from right to left to give the impression that the ball is moving forward (see the following storyboard shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.6</em>).</p>
			<p>We need a vertical movement for the ball and a horizontal movement for the background; also, it won't take the same amount of time for the ball to bounce as the looped background takes to move. So, the space and time of both animations are going to be different. And here's where we will create two (well, three – I will explain why in a moment) different compositions.</p>
			<p>We create one composition for the bouncing ball and one for the background, and when we combine these two, we will have our third composition – the container that will have all the animation on it:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer062" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_06.jpg" alt="Figure 3.6 – One composition versus two compositions&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.6 – One composition versus two compositions</p>
			<p>Some advantages<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> of having separated <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>compositions are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reusing a composition</strong>: The<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> same composition can be reused as many times as we want. Let's say I have a bunch of birds flying in the background; I only have to create one composition of a flying bird and duplicate this composition:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer063" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_07.jpg" alt="Figure 3.7 – A comp bird storyboard and a group of comp birds&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.7 – A comp bird storyboard and a group of comp birds</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Nested compositions</strong>: You can <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>have a composition inside a composition, which is usually <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>called <strong class="bold">a p</strong><strong class="bold">recomp</strong>. Why is that so useful? Let's go back to our bird. We've got a bird moving its wings but not moving forward in space, and we want the bird to cross the screen. We can create a new composition with our moving-wings bird inside. The animation in the new composition will be moving the bird from point A to B, and because the bird is already <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>moving itself, it will look like it is flying:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer064" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_08.jpg" alt="Figure 3.8 – A comp bird animation and a precomp of the comp bird flying animation&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.8 – A comp bird animation and a precomp of the comp bird flying animation</p>
			<p>As you can see, reusing <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>compositions and nested compositions is going to save us a lot of time and effort. So, now that we understand what a composition is, let's create one.</p>
			<h3>Composition settings</h3>
			<p>By now, we've <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>got a clear idea of what a composition is, so let's see what we can do with it. Let's create one by clicking <strong class="bold">Composition</strong> | <strong class="bold">New Composition…</strong> on the top bar menu:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer065" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_09.jpg" alt="Figure 3.9 – Creating a new composition&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.9 – Creating a new composition</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Composition</strong> panel opens up, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.10</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer066" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_10.jpg" alt="Figure 3.10 – The Composition Settings window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.10 – The Composition Settings window</p>
			<p>As you can see, there<a id="_idIndexMarker117"/> are a few settings to define here, so let's go through them one by one:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Composition Name</strong>: Here's where we can give our composition a name, so let's get creative here; let's name it <strong class="source-inline">my_first_composition</strong>.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Basic</strong> tab: As you can see, there are three main tabs at the top – <strong class="bold">Basic</strong>, <strong class="bold">Advanced</strong>, and <strong class="bold">3D Renderer</strong>. We only need to know a couple of <strong class="bold">Basic</strong> options, so forget about the other two. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Composition size</strong>: Here is where we will give a specific size to our composition. We can change the size further in the process, but it is always better to set it up right from the beginning. If this is going to be the main composition of the project, I like to give it the size of my design, which matches the size of the place the Lottie file is going to be placed. Of course, Lottie is scalable and responsive, but we don't want a tiny icon of, say, 60 x 60 pixels in a container of 400 x 800 pixels. So, let's keep it tidy.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lock Aspect Ratio</strong>: If this option is checked, the proportion of our animation will always be 16:9 by default. But since we are not doing video, we don't need this aspect ratio, so we can uncheck it and just put the size we want.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Frame Rate</strong>: We talked about this in <a href="B17930_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating the Illusion: Get Rolling With the Basic Principles of 2D Classic Animation</em>. Here is where we will decide how many frames per second our animation is going to have. For websites and apps, I normally use 60 frames per second.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Duration</strong>: Here, we <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>determine the duration of our composition. If we are designing an animated icon, this won't probably be longer than 3 to 5 seconds. And remember, each composition we have in our project will have its own duration independently.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Background Color</strong>: This is the color our composition will have as a background. However, this color is not going to show when rendering the movie; it is just a helpful aid for us to distinguish the design from the background. If we want our composition to have a background color, we will have to add a colored layer as a background.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So far, so good! We've just learned what a composition is, why it is so useful, and how to create and set up one, so let's move on to the timeline and layers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Timeline</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> is the<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> panel where we can control our animation. Move it back and forward, move to a specific part, to a second, or to a keyframe of our project. The timeline is also where we can find the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel and where we will add our frames and keyframes.</p>
			<p>Also, each composition has its own timeline, which means we can have a timeline within a timeline.</p>
			<p>Let's see an example of how the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> panel looks in <em class="italic">Figure 3.11</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer067" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_11.jpg" alt="Figure 3.11 – The Timeline panel&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.11 – The Timeline panel</p>
			<p>By looking at the preceding screenshot, we can see there are a few key areas in our <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> panel; let's look at <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>each of these parts in more detail:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Indicates the current time in timeline.</li>
				<li>This area is called the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel, and as you can see, it is placed within the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> panel. We will be talking about this in the following section.</li>
				<li>This is called<a id="_idIndexMarker121"/> the <strong class="bold">timeline's zoom</strong>. Drag it left to right to see how the timeline's frame area zooms in and out.</li>
				<li>This gray line indicates the work area we are working on. Our composition can be 5 seconds long, but say we only want the animation to be 1 second. We don't need to change our composition settings. We can move the blue start and end points to adjust it to the time we need it to be.</li>
				<li>This is the visualization of the layer in the timeline. If there's no color, it means the layer has ended or is starting later on the timeline, so it won't be showing at this specific time.</li>
				<li>This is the area where keyframes and ease are represented.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Note the blue vertical line in the timeline's panel. This<a id="_idIndexMarker122"/> is the <strong class="bold">time slider</strong>, which indicates the current time at any point in the animation. Try to drag it left to right to move in time within our composition.</p>
			<p>I must say, it is hard to talk about timeline panels without talking about layers, so I'm going to be mixing these two from now on. Let's introduce layers.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Understanding layers</h1>
			<p>A composition<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> without layers would be just an empty frame. As we said earlier in this chapter, compositions are formed from one or more layers, and anything you add to it, such as shapes, text, images, and audio, will become a layer as well.</p>
			<p>Let's see that in practice:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="source-inline">chapter03/AEbasics.ae</strong> file that we provided with this book.</li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel, you'll see a bunch of different compositions and files.</li>
				<li>Double-click on the composition called <strong class="bold">Animation</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer068" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_12.jpg" alt="Figure 3.12 – The Project panel&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.12 – The Project panel</p>
			<p>Now, let's check what we've got in the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel. As you can see, several different types of layers have appeared in the timeline, and each of these layers has its own properties as well, such as size, position, rotation, and opacity. These properties are very important as we'll see soon because by tweaking them, we will be able to start animating, but let's not rush.</p>
			<p>The layer's position in the<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> timeline is also important. The layers at the top will show in front of the layers at the bottom. So, we will normally put the background at the bottom and the objects we want to show on top at the top of the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel. We can do that just by dragging layers around in the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer069" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_13.jpg" alt="Figure 3.13 – The Layer panel&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.13 – The Layer panel</p>
			<p>Let's learn about the different types of layers before we start messing around with properties.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Type of layers</h2>
			<p>As we are<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> getting deeper into details about compositions, more and more options are opening in front of us. Now, we know a composition can contain as many layers as we want, including compositions as well. In AE, we can find different types of layers such as video, audio, light, camera, and GIFs. However, we are going to focus on the ones that we will be using for vector animations, which are <strong class="bold">Shape</strong>, <strong class="bold">PreComp</strong>, <strong class="bold">Illustrator</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Text</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.13</em>.</p>
			<p>Let's look at them more in detail.</p>
			<h3>Shape Layer</h3>
			<p>Even if it <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>is not the best way to draw your assets (we will explore some other ways to do it further in this section), we can use the tools that AE provides us to<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> create some illustrations. When we do that, we are creating a shape layer. Try to experiment yourself by using the tools you can find in the toolbar, at the top left of the screen:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer070" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_14.jpg" alt="Figure 3.14 – Toolbar&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.14 – Toolbar</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The Zoom tool</li>
				<li>The Rotation tool</li>
				<li>The Rectangle tool</li>
				<li>The Bezier tool</li>
				<li>The Pen tool</li>
				<li>The Brush tool</li>
				<li>Fill color</li>
				<li>Stroke color and width</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Take the<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> Rectangle tool, for example. Go to the composition <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>screen and draw a square. You'll notice a new layer will appear on the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel, which is a shape layer:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer071" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_15.jpg" alt="Figure 3.15 – The shape layer&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.15 – The shape layer</p>
			<h3>The PreComp layer</h3>
			<p>Remember when we talked <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>about <strong class="bold">precomp</strong> layers in the <em class="italic">Understanding compositions</em> section? A precomp layer is a layer formed by a composition<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> inside another composition, otherwise known as a nested composition. But how do we create one? It's as easy as dragging the file into the layer's <strong class="bold">Composition</strong> panel. Let's see an example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go to the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel.</li>
				<li>Double-click on the <strong class="bold">Animation</strong> composition.</li>
				<li>Drag the <strong class="bold">tree comp</strong> file from the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel to the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel.</li>
				<li>That's it! You'll see that a new layer named <strong class="bold">[tree]</strong> appears in the <strong class="bold">Animation</strong> layer's panel:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer072" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_16.jpg" alt="Figure 3.16 – tree is a precomp of the Animation composition&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.16 – tree is a precomp of the Animation composition</p>
			<h3>The Illustrator layer</h3>
			<p>As we<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> mentioned earlier, AE is not the best way to create your<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> graphics, as there are some other tools that will make your work easier – for example, Adobe Illustrator. Here's why. Files imported to AE from Illustrator will be linked, so any changes we make in the original file will be reflected in AE instantly, without the need to change them in AE.</p>
			<p>It's like magic! Do you want to see how? Cool, but keep in mind then that to do this, we need Adobe Illustrator<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> installed on our computer. Remember that we've provided you with some files to <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>play around with, so let's open them up:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open Adobe Illustrator.</li>
				<li>Go to <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Open</strong> from the top main Illustrator menu.</li>
				<li>Search for the <strong class="source-inline">chapter03</strong> folder from the provided files and open it.</li>
				<li>Search for the <strong class="source-inline">tree.ai</strong> file and open it.</li>
				<li>Change anything in the illustration – for example, I've changed the tree from white to pink, but you can do anything you like. Try changing the shape, adding some texture... whatever you like.</li>
				<li>Now, this is very important – save it! Otherwise, your changes won't be reflected.</li>
				<li>Go back to AE and see for yourself. As you can see, any changes you do in Illustrator will automatically be reflected in AE:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer073" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_17.jpg" alt="Figure 3.17 – A view of the tree.ai file in Adobe Illustrator and the Adobe AE window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.17 – A view of the tree.ai file in Adobe Illustrator and the Adobe AE window</p>
			<h3>The Text layer</h3>
			<p>If we want<a id="_idIndexMarker136"/> to include some text in our animation, we can do that <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>directly in AE. Try the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Text</strong> tool, as shown earlier in <em class="italic">Figure 3.14</em>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Composition</strong> panel and write something.</li>
				<li>You'll see a new panel appear on the right side of the screen. In this panel, you've got plenty of options to personalize your text:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer074" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_18.jpg" alt="Figure 3.18 – The Character style panel&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p>Cool, so we have covered the different types of layers that are best to use for our vector animations. Now, let's see in more depth what we can do with them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Layer properties</h2>
			<p>As you<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> know by now, each layer has properties. These properties can be modified and animated, which is how we will bring our illustrations to life.</p>
			<p>So, this basic set of properties that each layer has is called the <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> group. This can be found by clicking on the little arrow each layer has on the left-hand side. So, let's expand them:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer075" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_19.jpg" alt="Figure 3.19 – A view of the Layer panel after clicking on each layer's arrow&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.19 – A view of the Layer panel after clicking on each layer's arrow</p>
			<p>As we <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>mentioned, every layer has its own <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> group. We can also see that some types of layers have specific properties, but for now, we are going to just focus on the <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> group.</p>
			<p>So, let's click, for example, on the transformation group of <strong class="bold">Shape Layer</strong> and see what happens… <em class="italic">voilá!</em> The <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> properties expand: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer076" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_20.jpg" alt="Figure 3.20 – A detailed view of the Shape Layer Transform group properties&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.20 – A detailed view of the Shape Layer Transform group properties</p>
			<p>Nice! We can see all the <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> properties now, and here's where we are going to be performing most of our magic. These properties are really powerful and will allow us to create our animations, by transforming, rotating, changing opacity, and moving the graphics on screen. We are going to create the illusion of animation. So, let's get into more detail and see what we can do with each property.</p>
			<h3>Anchor point</h3>
			<p>Transformations <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>such as scale or rotation are done around an <strong class="bold">anchor point</strong>. The<a id="_idIndexMarker141"/> anchor point is, by default, at the center of a layer, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.21</em>. Sometimes, we will need the anchor point to be placed somewhere else, maybe in one of the corners, or somewhere else in the layer.</p>
			<p>If that's the case, I highly recommend doing it at the beginning before we start animating a<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> layer, as when we change the anchor point position, the scale and rotation behavior is going to be different. See the following example in <em class="italic">Figure 3.21</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer077" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_21.jpg" alt="Figure 3.21 – A centered anchor point versus a bottom/left-hand-corner anchor point for the scale and rotation properties&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.21 – A centered anchor point versus a bottom/left-hand-corner anchor point for the scale and rotation properties</p>
			<p>We can choose the anchor point position by choosing the <strong class="bold">Pan</strong> tool from the tools panel, and just dragging and dropping it in the composition screen. We can also change its value in the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer078" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_22.jpg" alt="Figure 3.22 – The anchor point values are set to x = 0,0 and y = 0,0 by default&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.22 – The anchor point values are set to x = 0,0 and y = 0,0 by default</p>
			<h3>Position</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Position</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker143"/> the place where our layer is going to take on a composition. We can move our layer around a composition and place it wherever we want, even outside the visible frame of the composition. Just try moving the layer around the composition screen or changing its values in the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer079" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_23.jpg" alt="Figure 3.23 – The Position value based on the layer's position in the composition screen&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.23 – The Position value based on the layer's position in the composition screen</p>
			<h3>Scale</h3>
			<p>It's the<a id="_idIndexMarker144"/> turn of <strong class="bold">Scale</strong>. Layers can also be scaled up or down. Remember when we talked about the anchor point and said our objects will behave depending on where the anchor point is positioned? We can change the size of a layer in the composition screen by pulling our layer handles up or down or changing them:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer080" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_24.jpg" alt="Figure 3.24 – Handles represented by little squares&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.24 – Handles represented by little squares</p>
			<p>We can change the scale from the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel as well. Note the little icon at the left of the values. This is by default active and means our layer is going to scale up or down, keeping its proportions. Uncheck it if you want to scale the layer only on its vertical or horizontal axis:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer081" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_25.jpg" alt="Figure 3.25 – Scale is set to x = 100% and y = 112.7% by default&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.25 – Scale is set to x = 100% and y = 112.7% by default</p>
			<h3>Rotation</h3>
			<p>We can<a id="_idIndexMarker145"/> rotate our layer. To do that, we can select the <strong class="bold">Rotation</strong> tool on the tools panel and spin our layer around in the composition screen, or we can change values in the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel. The first value shown in the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel, which by default is <strong class="bold">0x</strong>, stands for the amount of turns we want our layer to make:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer082" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_26.jpg" alt="Figure 3.26 – Rotation is defined by 0x = number of turns and the degrees, set by default to 0,0 degrees&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.26 – Rotation is defined by 0x = number of turns and the degrees, set by default to 0,0 degrees</p>
			<h3>Opacity</h3>
			<p>Another<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> interesting property is <strong class="bold">Opacity</strong>. We can change this from <strong class="bold">0%</strong> to <strong class="bold">100%</strong>, the former being totally transparent and the latter fully opaque. We can change opacity by changing the value directly in the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer083" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_27.jpg" alt="Figure 3.27 – Opacity set by default to 100%&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.27 – Opacity set by default to 100%</p>
			<p>Now<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> that we've learned all about layers, types of layers, and their main properties, let's move on to the Parent and Link feature.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Animating using the Parent &amp; Link option</h1>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> last section, we learned how to apply properties to a layer. Now, what if we want different layers to behave in the same way? Do we have to change the properties in all of these layers? Well, not really!</p>
			<p>In AE, we can link one layer to another one<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> by <strong class="bold">parenting</strong>. The main layer is called a <strong class="bold">parent</strong> and<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> the linked layer will be <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>called a <strong class="bold">child</strong>. Simply put, we can say that parenting is a way to group layers.</p>
			<p>Here are some aspects to keep in mind:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A layer can only have one parent, but each parent layer can have as many children as we want.</li>
				<li>We can animate child layers on their own.</li>
				<li>When creating parenting, we can choose whether the child is going to adopt the parent's properties or not.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>But where is the parent option? It is placed in the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel; however, sometimes it can be hidden. If that's so, just right-click anywhere in the top bar in your <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel to reveal a new menu. Choose <strong class="bold">Columns</strong> | <strong class="bold">Parent &amp; Link</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer084" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_28.jpg" alt="Figure 3.28 – The Layer panel view options&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.28 – The Layer panel view options</p>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>we are sure we can see the <strong class="bold">Parent</strong> option in the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> panel, let's see how to <em class="italic">parent</em> a layer.</p>
			<p>Parenting a layer is really easy to do. Just drag the pick whip icon to the layer you want to link, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.29</em>. And it's done!</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer085" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_29.jpg" alt="Figure 3.29 – Using the pick whip in the Parent &amp; Link view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.29 – Using the pick whip in the Parent &amp; Link view</p>
			<p>I would recommend you take your time to mess around with Parent &amp; Link to get familiar with it.</p>
			<p>So, now that we've learned what Parent &amp; Link are and how to apply them to a layer, let's move on to keyframes and animation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Keyframes and animation</h2>
			<p>Animation <a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>couldn't <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>be possible <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>without <strong class="bold">keyframes</strong>. As we mentioned earlier in <a href="B17930_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating the Illusion: Get Rolling With the Basic Principles of 2D Classic Animation</em>, an animation is composed of keyframes and inbetweens.</p>
			<p>AE generates the <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>inbetween frames for us, so we don't need to create an animation frame by frame, which will save us a lot of time.</p>
			<p>That said, let's see <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>how this works. In the following screenshot, we have an example of a two-frame sequence and how it should look in the <strong class="bold">Layer</strong> and <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> panels:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer086" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_30.jpg" alt="Figure 3.30 – A representation of frames in the Layer and Timeline panels&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.30 – A representation of frames in the Layer and Timeline panels</p>
			<p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, creating keyframes is just a matter of guided steps. Let's see how it is done:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click <strong class="bold">Stopwatch</strong> to activate and create your first keyframe. If you click again, all keyframes will be erased.</li>
				<li>Click the little diamond to <strong class="bold">Add/Remove Keyframes</strong>. Click arrows next to the diamond to move to the existing keyframes in the timeline.</li>
				<li>Keyframe position A in the timeline.</li>
				<li>Keyframe position B in the timeline.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We know we can animate a property when we see the little stopwatch icon next to it. When clicking on it (see <strong class="bold">1</strong> in <em class="italic">Figure 3.30</em>), little arrows and a diamond (see <strong class="bold">2</strong> in <em class="italic">Figure 3.30</em>) will appear. </p>
			<p>When clicking on the stopwatch, our first frame will be created. Go on, try it! Let's do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Let's go to the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel and double-click on the <strong class="bold">bouncing ball</strong> composition.</li>
				<li>Let's <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>place our<a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> time slider at <strong class="bold">0</strong> seconds (which we talked about in the <em class="italic">Timeline</em> section):</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer087" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_31.jpg" alt="Figure 3.31 – The bouncing ball composition with the time slider at frame 0&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.31 – The bouncing ball composition with the time slider at frame 0</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Choose the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> property and click on the stopwatch next to it. Note that our new keyframe will be created just where our time slider is placed. We will call that <strong class="bold">keyframe A</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer088" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_32.jpg" alt="Figure 3.32 – A view of the Layer and Timeline panels after clicking on the position stopwatch&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.32 – A view of the Layer and Timeline panels after clicking on the position stopwatch</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Now, let's move the time slider from <strong class="bold">0</strong> to half a second (<strong class="bold">30f</strong>).</li>
				<li>Click on the diamond icon. Remember that if we click again on the stopwatch, we are deleting all keyframes in that property. We will call that <strong class="bold">keyframe B</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer089" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_33.jpg" alt="Figure 3.33 – A second keyframe is created after clicking on the diamond icon on the left&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.33 – A second keyframe is created after clicking on the diamond icon on the left</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">Now, let's <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>move the time slider to <strong class="bold">1</strong> second.</li>
				<li>Click <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>again on the diamond to create our keyframe:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer090" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_34.jpg" alt="Figure 3.34 – The time slider at frame 60 and keyframe C&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.34 – The time slider at frame 60 and keyframe C</p>
			<p>Cool, we've got our keyframes created, so now what? If we move the time slider from <strong class="bold">A</strong> to <strong class="bold">C</strong>, nothing is happening, right? Well, that's because our keyframes are exactly the same, with the same properties, color, and so on, so we don't see anything changing.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="8">Now, move the time slider to <strong class="bold">keyframe B</strong> (<strong class="bold">30f</strong>).</li>
				<li>Let's change its vertical position to <strong class="bold">80</strong>. Remember that you can do that by changing the property value in the layer's composition:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer091" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_35.jpg" alt="Figure 3.35 – Set position to x = 25 and y = 80&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.35 – Set position to x = 25 and y = 80</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="10">Drag the time slider from <strong class="bold">A</strong> to <strong class="bold">C</strong>. What's happening now? The ball is bouncing! Yes! We've just created our first animation!</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>press the <em class="italic">spacebar</em> as well to make the animation<a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> play in a loop. So, let's check a few things here. When pressing the <em class="italic">spacebar</em>, the animation plays one time, stops momentarily, and then starts again. Why is that?</p>
			<p>It's because our animation is 1 second long but we decided our composition's length was going to be 5 seconds, remember? No problem – we can adjust that at any time. Let's open the composition settings.</p>
			<p>Go to the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> panel, right-click on the <strong class="bold">bouncing ball</strong> composition, select C<strong class="bold">omposition Settings…</strong>, and change the duration to 1 second, as we saw earlier in the chapter (<strong class="bold">6</strong> in <em class="italic">Figure 3.10</em>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer092" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_36.jpg" alt="Figure 3.36 – The Project panel&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.36 – The Project panel</p>
			<p>Let's press the <em class="italic">spacebar</em> now. Cool! Our ball is moving up and down in an endless loop. It's still not quite a bouncing ball, but it will get there!</p>
			<p>What <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>else <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>can we see here? If we check our ball on the compositions screen, we can see a line and a few dots:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer093" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_37.jpg" alt="Figure 3.37 – Our bouncing ball view in the composition window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.37 – Our bouncing ball view in the composition window</p>
			<p>Let's see what all that means:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The top square dot is our <strong class="bold">B</strong> keyframe.</li>
				<li>The little dots are the inbetween frames that AE creates for us.</li>
				<li>The bottom square dots are our <strong class="bold">A</strong> and <strong class="bold">C</strong> keyframes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So, we've got our bouncing ball, but it still looks a bit weird, right? The timing doesn't seem right. I think we are ready to talk about ease now.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Exploring ease</h1>
			<p>As the <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>name indicates, <strong class="bold">ease</strong> means moving carefully or gradually. In AE, ease is the effect that allows us to give the impression that our object is moving at different speeds within the same animation. It accelerates or slows down, depending on the effect we want to achieve.</p>
			<p>How do we <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>add ease to our animations? Easy – we will add ease by selecting the diamond keyframe in the timeline. Let's try it out!</p>
			<p>Remember in the last section when we animated our ball? Let's run it a few times just to remember how it looks (press the <em class="italic">spacebar</em>). What's happening?</p>
			<p>We can see the ball moving up and down at a constant speed, which looks unnatural. Remember the 12 principles of animation we talked about back in <a href="B17930_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating the Illusion: Get Rolling With the Basic Principles of 2D Classic Animation</em>? Ease is one of the 12 principles; real-life objects don't move at a regular speed.</p>
			<p>To make the movement look more natural, we want our bouncing ball to slow down when it reaches the top and slow down when it hits the floor. That involves using the ease effect, which uses acceleration and deceleration. Let's start playing around with ease, first with easy ease.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Easy ease</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Easy ease</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>an option that AE offers to add ease quickly and effortlessly. So, let's move to the timeline and do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the <strong class="bold">0</strong> keyframe (remember that we can use the timeline's zoom to adjust our view).</li>
				<li>Right-click the mouse and select <strong class="bold">Keyframe Assistant</strong> | <strong class="bold">Easy Ease</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer094" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_38.jpg" alt="Figure 3.38 – Right-click on the keyframe menu&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.38 – Right-click on the keyframe menu</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Let's have a look at our timeline; you'll notice the diamond figure has changed to a different one. That means that this frame has the ease effect on it.</li>
				<li>Now, let's <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>select the second keyframe (<strong class="bold">30f</strong>). Remember that you can also navigate through keyframes by clicking on the little arrows next to the diamond. This may come in handy when working with long timelines.</li>
				<li>Right-click and select <strong class="bold">Keyframe Assistant</strong> | <strong class="bold">Easy Ease</strong>. Why are we choosing this? Because we want our frame to slow down when entering and when exiting the keyframe, from both sides.</li>
				<li>Now, let's have a look at our timeline again; you'll notice this keyframe looks different from the first one, which indicates that it has the ease effect active on entering and exiting the frame, from both sides:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer095" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_39.jpg" alt="Figure 3.39 – Easy ease in and easy ease keyframe representations&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.39 – Easy ease in and easy ease keyframe representations</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="7">Finally, let's click on the third frame.</li>
				<li>Right-click <strong class="bold">Keyframe Assistant</strong> | <strong class="bold">Easy Ease Out</strong>, as we want our ball to slow down before hitting the floor.</li>
				<li>Check the keyframe; it looks different from all of them. The shape that appears indicates ease out:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer096" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.40 – Easy ease out</p>
			<p>Now, let's play it! What do you think? The animation looks much better now; the acceleration <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>and deceleration of the ball make a lot more sense, and it looks more real. What now? We can <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>add a <strong class="bold">squash and stretch</strong> effect.</p>
			<p>Just to refresh your memory, back in <a href="B17930_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating the Illusion: Get Rolling With the Basic Principles of 2D Classic Animation</em>, when we talked about the 12 principles of animation that help our animations look more realistic, we gave an example of a bouncing ball that stretches and expands along the way to give a more realistic effect.</p>
			<p>Now, I encourage you to experiment on your own with squash and stretch and apply it to a bouncing ball animation. If you want to see the final results, you can open the example provided with this book, <strong class="source-inline">chapter03/</strong> <strong class="source-inline">AEbasics_bouncingball_squash_stretch</strong>, to check how the animation is done and play around with keyframes, width, height, and also ease.</p>
			<p>But let's go a bit deeper into ease. Let's talk about the Graph Editor.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Graph Editor</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Graph Editor</strong> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>window where we can see a graphical representation<a id="_idIndexMarker173"/> of ease, and it is also where we can create and edit ease by hand and adjust our animation's speed.</p>
			<p>Let's have a look; click on the following little icon in the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> panel:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer097" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_03_41.jpg" alt="Figure 3.41 – The Graph Editor icon&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.41 – The Graph Editor icon</p>
			<p>When clicking <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>on it, you'll notice that the timeline changes to a kind of graph. This is the<a id="_idIndexMarker175"/> Graph Editor. You can click again to go back to your timeline. In the <strong class="bold">Graph Editor</strong> panel, note a few things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The yellow squares represent our keyframes; as you can see, they are placed in the same timing as in our timeline (<strong class="bold">0</strong>, <strong class="bold">30</strong>, and <strong class="bold">1</strong>).</li>
				<li>The green curve represents the inbetweens on the <em class="italic">y</em> axis or, in other words, the speed of the vertical movement of the ball. By looking at the chart, we can tell that our ball decreases in speed until it hits the top and then accelerates until it hits the floor.</li>
				<li>The red straight line represents the inbetweens in the <em class="italic">x</em> axis. But why is it flat? Because there is no movement on the horizontal axis. Our ball is only moving up and down:</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I invite you to play around to get familiar with the Editor. You'll see that you can move the keyframes around the panel by dragging them. That will change the speed and the position of <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>the ball to create a different effect. You can also change the curves by <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>dragging the handles and adjusting your animation.</p>
			<p>Also, you can change the editor panel's view from <strong class="bold">Values</strong> to <strong class="bold">Speed</strong>. Just right-click anywhere in the <strong class="bold">Graph Editor</strong> panel to reveal a new submenu and select <strong class="bold">Edit Speed Graph</strong>:</p>

			<p>When selecting <strong class="bold">Edit Speed Graph</strong>, we can see that our panel changes to a different view. Now, instead of seeing the <em class="italic">x and y</em> axes, we just see one gray line, which represents the variation of the speed in our animation.</p>
			<p>Again, play around with the handles and keyframes and choose the visualization you feel more comfortable working with:</p>

			<p>What we've just shown you, easy ease, is an ideal way to start understanding what ease is and how it works. However, once <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>you start getting familiar with it, you'll see that it is much better to <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>create ease on your own directly in the <strong class="bold">Graph Editor</strong> panel. But at this stage, we are just going to be focusing on this, which is enough for us to make our animations look better and give us enough knowledge to keep us going and learning at our own pace.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>We are done! Yes, in just one chapter. Don't be surprised; as we said earlier, we've got to be practical here. There's no need to start learning every single tool, panel, action, or expression available in AE, as there are so many things we don't need to know for our Lottie animations. So, we wanted to keep it simple for you.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we've discovered the AE workspace area, talked about the main panels, and got experience with real files with working with compositions, the timeline, and layers. We've been through layer properties, learned what the Parent &amp; Link feature is and how to apply it to our layers, and learned how to create our first animation while explaining how to use keyframes to finally refine it, thanks to ease and the <strong class="bold">Graph Editor</strong> panel.</p>
			<p>Looking back to the first part of the book, we've come a long way. We've learned what Lottie is, the principles of animation, and the basics of Adobe AE; we are now ready to move on to the second part of the book and perform some magic. Let's get started with our animated icon! I invite you to follow me to the next chapter.</p>
