    will be mainly on creating component-based user interfaces. It's one thing to
    understand a framework like Angular, but it's a whole different thing to establish
    an effective workflow using a component-based architecture. In this book, I'll
    try to explain the core concepts behind Angular components and how we can leverage
    this architecture to create modern, efficient, and maintainable user interfaces.

    Interface design is really not about pages. To create efficient user interfaces

    all the internals of the closed system and about the kind of logic and data that
    we've put into it. We should focus only on its surface, which allows us to work
    on a higher-abstraction level. Similar to the previous diagram, without using
    a hierarchy of encapsulated components, we'd have all our code cobbled together
    on the same level.

    components in a more limited fashion that didn't provide great flexibility or
    extensibility. Most of these frameworks just provided widget libraries. The problem
    with UI widgets is that they mostly don't embrace the pattern of composition enough.
    You can arrange widgets on a page and they provide encapsulation, but with most
    toolkits, you can't create larger components by nesting them inside each other.
    Some toolkits solve this by providing a special kind of widget which was mostly
    called a container. However, this is not the same as a full-fledged component
    tree that allows you to create systems within systems. Containers were actually
    meant to provide a visual layout container rather than a composite container to
    form a larger system.

    fosters composition with components. However, the biggest difference to its first
    version is that now, your pages are no longer global views; they are simply components
    that are assembled from other components. If you've been following this chapter,
    you'll notice that this is exactly what a holistic approach to user interfaces
    demands. No more pages, but systems of components.

    behavior.

    and providers which are used inside of your application module, Angular is able
    to parse HTML templates very explicitly. This is really helpful when it comes
    to debugging. Let's say you're including an element within one of your component
    templates which does not match any of the selectors specified by the components
    within your module. Angular can now assert an error because you explicitly told
    it what components are available within your module. Without telling Angular which
    components belong to your application module, it would not be able to know if
    you're including a non-existing component within your template.

    Imagine you have a very complex application existing of hundreds of components.
    Without modules, Angular would need to follow each individual component to find
    out how they are dependent on each other. With modules, Angular can simply check
    what components are declared inside of the module to find all components.

    required. This is a very powerful feature, but it requires that you declare a
    bundle of application artefacts like components or directives, to be loaded asynchronously
    after your main application has started. `NgModule` comes in very handy at this
    point. By creating a separate module using `NgModule`, you can now define a part
    of your application consisting of new components and other artefacts. Within the
    build of your application, this module is then built separately into its own JavaScript
    resource, which can be loaded asynchronously at runtime by the router.

    modules if you like. However, there's no real benefit of structuring your application
    into submodules, unless you're exporting a submodule as a library, or if you're
    using the lazy loading feature of the router, as discussed earlier. It's crucial
    that you always import the Angular `BrowserModule` within your main application
    module. The `BrowserModule` contains all the Angular core components, directives,
    and other dependencies which are required in order to run your application within
    a browser environment.

    In our case, we use this ability to exchange the descriptor value (which is the
    annotated function) with a proxy function that will log the function call before
    calling the origin function (delegation). For simplification purposes, we've implemented
    a very simple yet incomplete function proxy. For real-world scenarios, it would
    be advisable to use a better proxy implementation, such as the ECMAScript 6 proxy
    object.

    As all directive, component, and service classes get instantiated from Angular
    dependency injection and not by us directly, these annotations help Angular find
    the correct dependencies. For this use case, function parameter decorators actually
    make a lot of sense.

    actually prefer TypeScript decorators, as they support the constructor parameter
    decorators that are used by Angular. Although the ECMAScript 6 syntax supports
    modules, we still need some sort of module loader that will actually load the
