- en: In this book, we will build a frontend web application for a **customer relationship
    management** (**CRM**) system. Starting with your environment setup, I will introduce
    you to the main features of UmiJS and how a project is structured. After that,
    we will explore Ant Design, a design system with a vast library of React components
    for quickly building modern and responsive user interfaces that deeply integrate
    with Umi.

    by implementing a consistent code style and using formatting tools such as Prettier
    and EditorConfig. You will also learn how to design and implement tests for frontend
