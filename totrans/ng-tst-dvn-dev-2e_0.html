<html><head></head><body><div class="preface" title="Preface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref08"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>This book will provide the reader with a complete guide to test-driven development (TDD) focused on JavaScript and then dive into an Angular approach. It will provide clear, step-by-step examples to continually reinforce the best practices in TDD. This book will look at both unit testing with Karma and end-to-end testing with Protractor, and not only focus on how to use the tools but understand the reason they were built and why they should be used. Throughout, there will be a focus on when, where, and how to use these tools, constantly reinforcing the principles of the test-driven development life cycle (test, execute, and refactor).</p><p>All examples in this book are based on Angular v2 and are compatible with Angular v4.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf08lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Introduction to Test-Driven Development">Chapter 1</a><span class="emphasis"><em>, Introduction to Test-Driven Development</em></span>, introduces us to the fundamentals of test-driven development by explaining why and how TDD can help in the development process.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Details of JavaScript Testing">Chapter 2</a><span class="emphasis"><em>, Details of JavaScript Testing</em></span>, covers TDD in a JavaScript context. This chapter explores the types of tests that need in JavaScript applications, such as unit testing, behavior testing, integration testing, and E2E testing. This also explains different types of JavaScript testing tools, frameworks, and their uses in the Angular app.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. The Karma Way">Chapter 3</a><span class="emphasis"><em>, The Karma Way</em></span>, explores the origins of Karma and why it has to be used in any Angular project. By the end of this chapter, readers will not only understand the problem that Karma solves but also will walk through a complete example using Karma.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. End-to-End Testing with Protractor">Chapter 4</a><span class="emphasis"><em>, End-to-End Testing with Protractor</em></span>, takes a look at end-to-end testing applications, through all the layers of an application. This chapter introduced readers to Protractor, the end-to-end testing tool from the Angular team. Then it explained why Protractor was created and how it solve the problems. Finally, it guide the readers step by step how to install, configure, and use Protractor with TDD on an existing Angular project.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Protractor, a Step Ahead">Chapter 5</a><span class="emphasis"><em>, Protractor, a Step Ahead</em></span>, goes a bit deeper with Protractor and explores some advanced configurations. And then it explains the test suite debugging process with examples. This also explores some commonly used Protractor APIs with the relevant example.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. The First Step">Chapter 6</a><span class="emphasis"><em>, The First Step</em></span>, provides an introductory walk-through of how to use TDD to build an Angular application with classes, components, and services. This chapter helps readers to begin the TDD journey and see the fundamentals in action. Up to this point, this book stays focused on a foundation of TDD and the tools. And then, by going a step forward it dives into TDD with Angular.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Flip Flop">Chapter 7</a><span class="emphasis"><em>, Flip Flop</em></span>, continues to expand our knowledge of applying TDD with Angular features such as routes and navigation to get the result set through our sample Angular application. Besides the Angular features, this also guides the readers how to apply end-to-end tests for those specific features with the help of Protractor. </p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Telling the World">Chapter 8</a><span class="emphasis"><em>, Telling the World</em></span>, covers more unit testing for the sample Angular application, including routes and navigation. Besides that, this chapter also refactor the existing code to make it more testable. And then it introduces to Angular services and event broadcasting while refactoring the code and introduce MockBackend to test HTTP requests in the service.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf08lvl1sec2"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, we have used <span class="strong"><strong>Node Package Manager</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>npm</strong></span>) as our command tool to run the application and various testing tools. So it's a prerequisite to have npm globally installed on your operating system. To install it, you must have Node.js installed on your operating system. </p><p>We will not look at how to install Node.js and npm. There are a lot of resources already available for installing them on any operating system. </p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf08lvl1sec3"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for developers who have basic experience with Angular but want to understand the wider context of when, why, and how to apply testing techniques and the best practices to create quality clean code. To get the most out of this book, you should have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a basic understanding of Angular with TypeScript.</p></div>
