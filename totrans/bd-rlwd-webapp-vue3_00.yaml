- en: Welcome to the Vue.js community, which is one of the most friendly frontend
    communities. Vue.js is a frontend framework that allows you to build performant
    interactive web applications with ease. Vue.js has a shallow learning curve –
    getting started is easy! This book guides you on your first steps to creating
    Vue.js applications with increasing complexity and size.

- en: Apart from showing you the technology and teaching you the best practices with
    Vue.js, the chapters of this book are set up to teach you about general development
    practices as well. The book lets you experience different approaches when dealing
    with new technology, implementing third-party solutions, or orchestrating more
    complex application structures.

- en: There are many resources that focus on very specific use cases or even single
    components. The aim of this book is to offer a realistic and broad view of Vue.js
    developer responsibilities and expectations. Every chapter will result in a functional
    application. Every application introduces a new concept to familiarize yourself
    with.

    complexity with every chapter. I will enforce concepts iteratively over the course
    of multiple chapters. I am experienced in using Vue.js in a complex, enterprise-level
    environment where my experience in adopting useful practices and working with
    third-party solutions has shaped the focal points of the structure and chapters.

    Vue.js and its ecosystem, but also prepare you to land a Vue.js developer job
    by growing a portfolio that showcases your capabilities as a professional web
    developer.

    to build the wildest applications. This is only possible because of the combined
    and relentless efforts of core maintainers and the numerous contributors that
    build and publish open source software. Please consider donating or participating
    to show your support as well. Any contribution to these frameworks or libraries
    is welcomed and much needed to keep maintaining and developing software that benefits
    us all.
