- en: And... here we are! Ready to start our own first animated project in Adobe After
    Effects! Yes! It has been an exciting journey, and we've learned loads of new
    words, concepts, and tools. Looking back, it seems like ages ago when we started
    talking about Lottie, don't you think? Not because of the matter of time, but
    because we've learned so many new things! In the first part of the book, we learned
    what Lottie and LottieFiles are, we went through the history and principles of
    2D classic animation, and got our hands on the Adobe After Effects working area
    and main animating features. Now, we are all ready and set to animate our icon.

- en: In this chapter, we are going to go step by step through creating our animated
    icon. Get ready, as we are going to put everything we've learned so far on the
    table, all the knowledge we've gained about Lottie, classic animation, and Adobe
    After Effects. We will learn how to import our assets from different vector-based
    tools, we will create and adjust our composition, create keyframes, and change
    layer properties to give the illusion of animation. We will also learn how to
    animate a path, adjust the timing, and apply ease, based on classic animation
    concepts, to give our icon a more trustable movement. So, by the end of this chapter,
    we will have our first animated icon ready to be exported for LottieFiles.

    effort to create an animation if we could just have a text or an illustration
    instead? Well, as we mentioned earlier, animations can be so helpful in terms
    of UX. They help us to talk to our users; we've learned how animation can communicate
    so many things, such as actions or emotions.

    assets to AE, set up a composition, create keyframes, and modify layer properties
    such as **Scale**, **Position**, **Rotation**, and **Opacity** to create our animation.

    how to adjust timing, and how to apply Ease to finalize our project.
