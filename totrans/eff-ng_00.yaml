- en: Angular is a powerful frontend framework developed and maintained by Google.
    Since its inception, it has become one of the most popular frameworks for building
    dynamic web applications. Angular’s component-based architecture, coupled with
    its strong TypeScript foundation, provides developers with a robust and scalable
    platform to craft modern applications.

    when creating your workspace. Additionally, you’ll set up your own Nx monorepo,
    which is ready to handle hundreds of Angular applications and libraries. After
    creating your Nx monorepo, you’ll learn about the newest features in the Angular
    framework, such as signals and standalone components. When you’re fully up to
    date with the latest developments of the Angular framework, you’ll do a deep dive
    into the Angular router, component communication, and dependency injection. Then,
    you will get hands-on experience with Angular directives, pipes, and animations
    and learn about the best practices, their impact on performance, and common pitfalls
    when using directives, pipes, or animations. You will finish the first part by
    creating template-driven, reactive, and dynamic forms, understanding their differences
    when you use each method and how you can adequately validate them.
