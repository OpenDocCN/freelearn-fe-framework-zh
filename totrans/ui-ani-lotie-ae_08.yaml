- en: Looking back, I realize how many new things we've been through. At the beginning
    of this book, Lottie was something you may have heard about but maybe you weren't
    sure what it was or how it worked, and now, just five chapters later, I'm sure
    you feel confident enough when talking about Lottie's environment, animations
    and **After Effects** (**AE**). You've learned about and experienced the benefits
    of creating animations with AE and LottieFiles, you are now familiar with Adobe
    AE, and are capable of ideating, sketching, creating, and exporting your own unique
    animations, and have had the chance to learn and experience a real **user experience**
    (**UX**) animation workflow on your own.

- en: That said, this chapter is a handy guide to keep closer when animating, a place
    you can come back to any time you need to find new resources for your animations.
    In the following sections, you'll find the links and instructions to download
    and install all the necessary tools and plugins we need to create our animations
    so you don't get lost.
