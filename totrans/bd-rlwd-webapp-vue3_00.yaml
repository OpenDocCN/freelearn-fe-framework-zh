- en: Welcome to the Vue.js community, which is one of the most friendly frontend
    communities. Vue.js is a frontend framework that allows you to build performant
    interactive web applications with ease. Vue.js has a shallow learning curve –
    getting started is easy! This book guides you on your first steps to creating
    Vue.js applications with increasing complexity and size.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apart from showing you the technology and teaching you the best practices with
    Vue.js, the chapters of this book are set up to teach you about general development
    practices as well. The book lets you experience different approaches when dealing
    with new technology, implementing third-party solutions, or orchestrating more
    complex application structures.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many resources that focus on very specific use cases or even single
    components. The aim of this book is to offer a realistic and broad view of Vue.js
    developer responsibilities and expectations. Every chapter will result in a functional
    application. Every application introduces a new concept to familiarize yourself
    with.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have designed the chapters to progress in a natural way, where we increase
    complexity with every chapter. I will enforce concepts iteratively over the course
    of multiple chapters. I am experienced in using Vue.js in a complex, enterprise-level
    environment where my experience in adopting useful practices and working with
    third-party solutions has shaped the focal points of the structure and chapters.

    processes – not writing perfect code from the start but embracing refactoring
    steps and improving software while an application grows.

    Vue.js and its ecosystem, but also prepare you to land a Vue.js developer job
    by growing a portfolio that showcases your capabilities as a professional web
    developer.

- en: Using technologies such as Vue.js, Nuxt, Pinia, and Vite is what enables us
    to build the wildest applications. This is only possible because of the combined
    and relentless efforts of core maintainers and the numerous contributors that
    build and publish open source software. Please consider donating or participating
    to show your support as well. Any contribution to these frameworks or libraries
    is welcomed and much needed to keep maintaining and developing software that benefits
    us all.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is aimed at software engineers with an affinity for web-based technologies.
    Anyone with a software engineering background should be able to quickly pick up
    the concepts in this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Primarily, the book aims to guide beginner or junior developers to familiarize
    themselves with Vue.js and frontend technologies and practices. This book helps
    them build up experience in a broad range of topics, which helps in more successfully
    applying for a position as a Vue.js developer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While not the primary focus, any software engineer who is curious about the
    Vue.js ecosystem can very well progress through the chapters, building up a broad
    sense of the possibilities of using Vue.js as a framework to build applications.
  prefs: []

- en: If you have an affinity with one of the currently popular frontend frameworks
    or libraries such as React, Angular, Svelte, or Qwik, you will have a head start
    in grasping concepts such as reactivity, testing, and fetching data from APIs.
    If you are looking to transition to a Vue.js-orientated position, this book will
    get you up to speed with the Vue.js approach to common practices.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B19563_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Introduction to Vue.js*,
    explains the core concepts we need to build Vue.js applications. It will help
    you set up a development environment with the recommended settings for Vue.js
    development.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B19563_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028), *Creating a Todo List App*,
    builds upon the core concepts and explains a key concept in creating interactive
    web applications – reactivity. It also introduces the development and debugging
    tools as important tools to maintain and inspect applications.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B19563_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058), *Building a Local Weather
    App*, explores external data as a resource of a web application. It will add a
    testing framework to the application, which we can use to increase the robustness
    of the application by identifying both happy and unhappy user flows and how to
    deal with those.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B19563_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092), *Building the Marvel Explorer
    App*, leans heavily on interacting with a great volume of external data and connecting
    to public APIs to retrieve the correct data for a user. It uses composables (a
    concept for working with stateful logic) to use and reuse functions and compose
    more complex behavior. By leveraging the default router, we will introduce multiple
    views and routes to an application.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B19563_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor130), *Building a Recipe App with
    Vuetify*, teaches you how to use third-party libraries, such as Vuetify, to quickly
    build an interface. It will strengthen the concept of working with APIs by iteration
    and introduce Pinia, the default state management library for Vue.js. With Pinia,
    you will learn to persist state in the browser. You will learn refactoring techniques
    and experience dealing with changing features and requirements.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B19563_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor162), *Creating a Fitness Tracker
    with Data Visualization* continues the topic of persisting state and teaches you
    how to store data in an external database, as well as adding entry-level authentication
    to a web application. It demonstrates trade-offs between abstraction and a more
    pragmatic approach when building a feature, revisiting refactoring strategies.'

- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B19563_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor204), *Building a Multi-Platform
    Expense Tracker Using Quasar*, sidesteps in a different direction, where you learn
    how to use web technologies to build applications for one or even multiple non-web
    platforms using a framework. It continues to solidify previously learned topics
    by revisiting similar tech stacks but with different goals and features in mind.'

    App*, dives deep into developing an app from backend to frontend and includes
    architectural concepts and decisions as well. It introduces Nuxt, which is one
    of the most popular and developer-friendly meta frameworks for the Vue.js ecosystem.
    You will interact with WebSockets and see how to create real-time interactivity
    between multiple clients at the same time.'

    with TensorFlow*, teaches you the prototyping practices and how to familiarize
    yourself with new technologies by experimenting in an isolated environment. It
    also touches upon developing and testing early on a specific target. Most importantly,
    it teaches you to have a bit of fun when building new projects, keeping you interested
    and motivated in your own continuous development.'

    Nuxt.js and Storyblok*, circles back to Nuxt as a framework to generate code,
    instead of acting as a real-time web server. This chapter allows you to create
    a personal project, where you can showcase your talents as a developer while progressing
    through this book. It connects the application to a headless **content management
    system** (**CMS**) and teaches you how to automate tasks such as deployments.'
