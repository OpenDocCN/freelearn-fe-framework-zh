    platform where Lottie animations can be uploaded, tested, and shared. By combining
    the LottieFiles plugin and the LottieFiles platform, you'll be able to create
    stunning animations that are easy to integrate with any device. You'll also see
    how to use the Bodymovin plugin in Adobe **After Effects** (**AE**) to export
    your animation to a JSON file.

- en: The book starts by giving you an overview of Lottie and LottieFiles. As you
    keep reading, you'll understand the entire Lottie ecosystem and get hands-on with
    classic 2D animation principles. You'll also get a step-by-step guided tour to
    ideate, sketch for storytelling, design an icon that will fulfill the needs and
    expectations of users based on UX, and finally, animate it in AE. This will help
    you get familiar with the AE environment, work with vector shape layers, create
    and modify keyframes using layer properties, explore path, Parent & Link features,
    and adjust timing easily to create professional-looking animations.

    own Lottie animations using AE and implement them in mobile apps using React Native.
    You'll also have an understanding of 2D animation best practices and principles
    that you can apply to your own projects.
