- en: All of the examples that you’ve implemented so far in this book have relied
    on user gestures. In traditional web applications, you mostly deal with mouse
    events. However, touchscreens rely on the user manipulating elements with their
    fingers, which is fundamentally different from the mouse.

    common gesture, besides touch. Then, you’ll learn about giving the user the appropriate
    level of feedback when they interact with your components. Finally, you’ll implement
    components that can be swiped.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scrolling in web applications is done by using the mouse pointer to drag the
    scrollbar back and forth or up and down, or by spinning the mouse wheel. This
    doesn’t work on mobile devices because there’s no mouse. Everything is controlled
    by gestures on the screen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you want to scroll down, you use your thumb or index finger
    to pull the content up by physically moving your finger over the screen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scrolling like this is difficult to implement, but it gets more complicated.
    When you scroll on a mobile screen, the velocity of the dragging motion is taken
    into consideration. You drag the screen fast, then let go, and the screen continues
    to scroll based on how fast you moved your finger. You can also touch the screen
    while this is happening to stop it from scrolling.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thankfully, you don’t have to handle most of this stuff. The `ScrollView` component
    handles much of the scrolling complexity for you. In fact, you’ve already used
    the `ScrollView` component back in *Chapter 20*, *Rendering Item Lists*. The `ListView`
    component has `ScrollView` baked into it.
  prefs: []

    life cycle methods. You’ll probably never need to do this, but if you’re interested,
    you can read about it at [https://reactnative.dev/docs/gesture-responder-system](https://reactnative.dev/docs/gesture-responder-system).

- en: The React Native examples you’ve worked with so far in this book have used plain
    text to act as buttons or links. In web applications, to make text look like something
    that can be clicked, you just wrap it with the appropriate link. There’s no link
    component in React Native, so you can style your text to look like a button.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem with trying to style text as links on mobile devices is that they’re
    too hard to press. Buttons provide a bigger target for fingers, and they’re easier
    to apply touch feedback on.

    and `onLongPress` callbacks and implement any touchable feedback that we want.

    applications is that they feel more intuitive. Using gestures, you can quickly
    get a handle on how things work. For example, swiping an element across the screen
    with your finger is a common gesture, but the gesture has to be discoverable.

    element moves back into place. You’ve just discovered how part of this application

    make a significant difference compared to mobile web platforms. We started off
    by looking at the `ScrollView` component, and how it makes life much simpler by
    providing native scrolling behavior for wrapped components.

    area that’s tricky to get right on the mobile web. We learned how to use the `TouchableOpacity`,
    `TouchableHighlight`, and Pressable API components to do this.
