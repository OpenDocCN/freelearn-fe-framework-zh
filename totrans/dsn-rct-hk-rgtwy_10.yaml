- en: In this last chapter of this book, we will talk about *React* in general, especially
    the role that *React* plays in web development. We will approach this topic from
    three aspects to see how *React* puts resources together to build a site. First,
    we will take a look at how *React* embraces new *JavaScript ES6* features, such
    as arrow function and template strings. Then, we will walk through how a component
    can be styled using a *CSS-in-JS* approach via libraries such as `styled-JSX`
    and `styled-components`. Last, but not least, we will also get to know JSX code
    and how it is used to transform the *HTML*-like lines into *JavaScript* expressions.

    people refer to it as a utility rather than a framework? There''s no clear definition
    of what should be called a framework and what shouldn''t. Judging by the amount
    of *React* source code and how it wires with other systems, we can hardly treat
    it as a utility library. But at the same time, we also should remember the goal
    that *React* established with in the first place, because knowing this will help
    you to use this technology in the right way. Let''s take a look at the usage:'

    element and renders a component under it. Moreover, afterward, the screen under
    that element gets "managed" by *React*. This means that *React* overwrites everything
    under that element and refreshes upon any state change inside the component.

    *React* with your project. As you see, this line is powerful. In fact, it can
    be used multiple times for one project. Consider the following *HTML* page:'

    For each element found, we take its `value` attribute and send it to a component
    with `ReactDOM.render`. Wow! All sliders are managed by *React*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although having multiple `render` instances is not a typical approach, we build
    a **Single Page Application** (**SPA**). This does give us one important message;
    that is, from the technical aspect, the goal of *React* is to replace and manage
    *DOM* elements on the screen. To make this happen, a new root fiber is created
    internally for each element so the engine knows where to start updating when a
    dispatch arrives.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We know by now what *React* is designed to do. Let's take a quick look at how
    much effort it takes to do this – for instance, what are all the dependencies
    to invoke the `render` statement?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE3]'

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: 'To kick off the engine, we need a `render` function provided by the `react-dom`
    package. The component can be designed somewhere else, which requires the utilities
    of the `react` package, such as `createElement` and `useState`:'
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Other than `react-dom` and `react` packages, it's the `document` object that
    we need to locate and manipulate the *DOM* element. But normally, as long as we
    have a browser session, we assume the `document` is available.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In short, there are two dependency packages. The `react` package is used for
    defining a component. With it, the component definition can be output into a format
    that the engine can understand. The `react-dom` package is used to render and
    manage the component to the screen. This means that before you kick off the engine,
    you don't need `react-dom`. Most of the development time is spent using the `react`
    package to define our components. From this exercise, we should clearly see the
    function of *React* as a utility library.

- en: To build a website with *React*, we need to do all the things that a web developer
    needs to do, that is, designing the site layout with *HTML*, making the site look
    beautiful with *CSS*, and adding business logic and interaction to engage the
    user with *JavaScript*. So, the question becomes how all these building blocks
    fit in the new component ecosystem. Let's take a look at them one at a time.
