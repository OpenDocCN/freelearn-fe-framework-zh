<p class="mce-root">This book, <em>Full Stack development with JHipster</em>, aims to address the following challenges faced by full-stack developers today:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>There are multitudes of technologies and options out there to learn</span></li>
<li>Customer demands have increased and hence time to market has become more stringent</li>
<li>Client-side frameworks have become complicated and difficult to integrate</li>
<li>There is so much integration between technologies and concepts that it overwhelms most novice and even proficient developers</li>
</ul>
<p>JHipster provides a platform for developers to easily create web applications and microservices from scratch, without having to spend a lot of time wiring everything together and integrating technologies together. This frees up time<span> immensely</span> for developers to actually focus on their solution rather than spending time learning and writing boilerplate code. JHipster will help novice and experienced developers to be more productive from day one. It's like pair programming with an entire community.</p>
<p>This book will take you on a journey from zero to hero in full stack development. You will learn to create complex production-ready Spring Boot and Angular web applications from scratch using JHipster and will go on to develop and deploy features and business logic on cloud services. You will also learn about microservices and how to convert a monolithic application into the microservice architecture as it evolves using JHipster. Additionally, you will learn how to make use of the new React support being introduced in JHipster and about various best practices and suggestions from the JHipster community and the core development team.</p>

<p class="western">Anyone with a basic understanding of building Java web applications and basic exposure to Spring and Angular/React can benefit from using this book to learn how to use JHipster for cutting-edge full-stack development or to improve their productivity by cutting down boilerplate and learning new techniques. The audience can be broadly classified as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="western">Full stack web app developers who want to reduce the amount of boilerplate they write and save time, especially for greenfield projects.</li>
<li>Backend developers who want to learn full stack development with Angular or React</li>
<li>Full-stack developers who want to learn microservice development</li>
<li>Developers who want to jump-start their full stack web application or microservice development</li>
<li>Developers who want to quickly prototype web applications or <span>microservices</span></li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Conventions used</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>At the backend, modify the <kbd>save</kbd> method of </span><kbd>ProductOrderService.java</kbd><span> to create an Invoice and Shipment for the </span><kbd>ProductOrder</kbd><span> and save them all</span>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">entity Product {<br/>    name String required<br/>    description String<br/>    price BigDecimal required min(0)<br/>    size Size required<br/>    image ImageBlob<br/>}<br/><br/>enum Size {<br/>    S, M, L, XL, XXL<br/>}<br/><br/>entity ProductCategory {<br/>    name String required<br/>    description String<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>entity ProductOrder {<br/>    placedDate Instant required<br/>    status OrderStatus required<br/>    <strong>invoiceId Long</strong><br/>    code String required<br/>}</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt; cd invoice</strong><br/><strong>&gt; ./gradlew</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "You can alternatively test this via your <span class="packt_screen">Gateway</span> application. Log in to    our <span class="packt_screen">Gateway</span> application and then navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Gateway</span>.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
