- en: '*Chapter 10* , *Behind the Scenes of React and Optimization Opportunities*
    , will take a look behind the scenes of React and dive into core topics like the
    virtual DOM, state update batching and key optimization techniques that help you
    avoid unnecessary re-render cycles (and thus improve performance).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 11* , *Working with Complex State* , will explain how the advanced
    React hook `useReducer` works, when and why you might want to use it and how it,
    can be used in React components to manage more complex component state with it.
    In addition, React’s Context API will be explored and discussed in depth, allowing
    you to manage app-wide state with ease.'
