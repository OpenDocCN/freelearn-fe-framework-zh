    a blank page. To let users know when they visit a non-existent page, we should
    create a custom 404 page.

    strategies we will be using. After that, we built the SEO component, which injects
    content into the head of the page.

    we built the pages for our application. To build the content for our pages, we
    used test data that was predefined. We used test data to render content on the
    pages, but we still need to make real API calls.

    use during development to make HTTP requests and fetch data as if we were consuming
    the real API.
