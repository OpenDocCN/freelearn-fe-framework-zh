    scratched its surface by demonstrating how we can use CSS Custom Properties to
    control theme properties and CSS Grid layouts. In this chapter, we will dig into
    the details of how to implement the application using the new Angular components
    that we introduced in [*Chapter 4*](B16295_04_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor055),

    want the user to be able to accomplish by using the component, as well as what
    data that use case requires, before digging into the details about the component

    lists of video courses, which will provide the user with a custom list of videos
    and location information for the video's content. To accomplish this, we will
    use the Angular YouTube Player to display videos and select schools via Angular
    Google Maps (for the **how**). It will be the school that creates the course,
    and the course will contain one or more videos that the user will watch.

    will be using, before describing **how** we are going to display or use the data.
    This will make it easier to separate data retrieval and storage from the actual
    usage of the different components. So, let's establish a data model before we
    use the new Angular components.

    courses stored in a session. We will revisit this in [*Chapter 8*](B16295_08_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor094),
