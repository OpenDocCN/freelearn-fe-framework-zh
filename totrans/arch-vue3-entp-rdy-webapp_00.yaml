    compression, code splitting, and tree shaking. Next, you’ll learn how to use RESTful
    API, Docker, GraphQL, and different types of testing to ensure that your Vue.js
    3 application is scalable and maintainable. By the end of this book, you will
    be able to build and deploy your enterprise-ready Vue.js 3 application using best
    practices in implementing RESTful API, Docker, GraphQL, and different testing
