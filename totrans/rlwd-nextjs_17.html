			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will know the next steps in your journey as a Next.js developer.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>One framework, endless possibilities</h1>
			<p>Since the beginning of our Next.js adventure, we've seen many different features that the framework gives <a id="_idIndexMarker790"/>us to build a better, faster web.</p>
			<p>One thing we should consider when talking about a framework is that it is not just about the technology. The community, ideas, and ecosystem are essential and deserve to be discussed in more detail.</p>
			<p>Next.js, in fact, is not just a web framework. We've already seen how it revolutionized the way we build our apps on the frontend and backend by providing exciting and unique features that make our lives easier without compromising our love for our work as developers.</p>
			<p>It isn't easy to talk about Next.js without mentioning how good and clever Vercel has been in creating something so unique.</p>
			<p>Not only does Vercel provide an incredible platform for deploying our applications, but it also puts a lot of effort into enhancing the web framework and its ecosystem.</p>
			<p>With the announcement of Next.js 11, the Vercel team also announced Next.js Live, a web browser-based <a id="_idIndexMarker791"/>environment for collaborating in real time with your team while coding any Next.js application.</p>
			<p>It is still in beta, but it's incredibly promising. I must admit that I was extremely excited the first time I tried it, as I can clearly see how this could boost a team's productivity when debugging, designing, and testing any Next.js-based website.</p>

			<p>Other than Vercel, there's an entire community of companies and individual contributors creating incredible extensions and libraries to simplify our job when building real-world Next.js applications.</p>
			<p>We have already used some of them in our journey, but there are many packages that can help us achieve great results with ease.</p>
			<p>There are also great GitHub repositories listing a selection of tools, tutorials, and libraries, such as <a href="https://github.com/unicodeveloper/awesome-nextjs">https://github.com/unicodeveloper/awesome-nextjs</a>. Here, you can find an exhaustive list of high-quality packages for every need.</p>
			<p>When browsing all those libraries, articles, and tutorials, you'll eventually see that the power of Next.js relies <a id="_idIndexMarker792"/>upon many different features. It might have been born as a "full-stack React.js framework," but now it's something more significant and diverse.</p>
			<p>In fact, we can clearly see how Next.js is more of a general-purpose framework that we can use for building any kind of application.</p>
			<p>In the past, we used to distinguish web frameworks and technologies according to their main domain of interest. For example, if we needed to build a complex and interactive product, our choices usually boiled down to Ruby on Rails, Symphony, or Spring Boot, just to name a few.</p>
			<p>Suppose we needed to build a simple company website. In that case, we might have chosen a static site generator, such as Jekyll, or a simple CMS, such as WordPress.</p>
			<p>I'm not saying that Next.js changed all of that. Still, it replaced a vast number of technologies and frameworks with a simple approach to web development, where an entire team can easily collaborate on a single project when building REST APIs (via API pages), React components, backend logic, <strong class="bold">user interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">UIs</strong>), and so on.</p>
			<p>Another thing that we should consider when adopting Next.js as a web framework is its impact at the architecture level.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B16985_11_Final_SB_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor113"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Different Deployment Platforms</em>, we discussed how to make decisions regarding how to host a Next.js app depending on its features and purpose.</p>
			<p>Some years ago, standard practices mandated deploying any web application on a hosted server. Today, we have many different opportunities to enhance our users' browsing experiences by choosing several alternatives for serving our apps. With more classic tech stacks, such as Laravel or Ruby on Rails, we have just a few choices; we could deploy them on an AWS EC2 cluster or a virtual private server hosted by any company. Next.js allows us to consider many alternatives for creating better deployment pipelines and user experiences by statically rendering certain pages at build time or server-side rendering other pages at runtime. This is a game-changer.</p>
			<p>To summarize, there's not just a single kind of web application where Next.js can be a good fit. It can be used for building any app thanks to its flexibility, robustness, and vast ecosystem.</p>
			<p>As of the time of writing, I can't <a id="_idIndexMarker793"/>tell you a single scenario where using Next.js is the wrong choice.</p>
			<p>Talking about possible scenarios, it might be the right time to introduce some little projects for practicing our Next.js knowledge before diving into production website development. In the next section, we will see some excellent ideas for little projects that can help us to practice real-world scenarios.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Real-world applications for practicing with Next.js</h1>
			<p>The best way to learn is through first-hand experience. In this book, we have covered several topics of <a id="_idIndexMarker794"/>increasing complexity and described various approaches for building real-world Next.js applications.</p>
			<p>Now it's time to get our hands dirty and start writing some great apps!</p>
			<p>When I started my career as a software engineer, I had difficulty finding suitable example applications to build for further learning; now, I want to give you the opportunity to practice by creating something worth sharing with your colleagues or friends, or even in your next job interview. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Streaming website</h2>
			<p>Streaming applications have become a massive part of our lives and changed the way we watch movies <a id="_idIndexMarker795"/>and TV shows forever. They're also an excellent use case for someone wanting to create a real-world <a id="_idIndexMarker796"/>application when learning more about a given technology.</p>
			<p>As a first real-world project, I'd like you to build a clone of your favorite streaming service. It must respect the following rules:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It must show a list of movies taken from the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org">https://www.themoviedb.org</a> database. This website exposes some beautiful free REST APIs; you can find the documentation here: <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api">https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api</a>.</li>
				<li>To complicate things (just like in real-world scenarios), a user must be authenticated to see all the movies available in the application.</li>
				<li>When a trailer is available, the <a id="_idIndexMarker797"/>user should be able to watch it on the movie page.</li>
				<li>All the images <a id="_idIndexMarker798"/>must be served using Next.js' <strong class="source-inline">&lt;Image/&gt;</strong> component.</li>
				<li>Users can log in and out.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Before starting to write the code for this application, I suggest you try to answer the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What kind of rendering strategy should I choose for the individual movie pages?</li>
				<li>Where should I deploy this application?</li>
				<li>How can I ensure that the user is logged in when browsing the website?</li>
				<li>How would the application perform if there were hundreds (or thousands) of concurrent users browsing it? Would that change my answer to the first question?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Of course, there are many other things to consider when building an application, but this is a good starting point.</p>
			<p>In the following example, we will see a different kind of application. You will have fixed technological requirements that you need to meet, as will be the case when you're working for any company.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Blogging platform</h2>
			<p>Let's pretend that you're working for a company and you're required to build a blogging website by attaching Next.js to <a id="_idIndexMarker799"/>a headless CMS, in this case, GraphCMS.</p>
			<p>You must observe the following requirements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You must use TailwindCSS for styling the UI.</li>
				<li>You must use TypeScript for coding the application.</li>
				<li>Every blog page must be statically rendered at build time.</li>
				<li>The UI must be as similar as possible to your favorite blog.</li>
				<li>Users can log in and save articles into a reading list.</li>
				<li>All the images must be served using Next.js' <strong class="source-inline">&lt;Image/&gt;</strong> component.</li>
				<li>SEO is essential. It must achieve a 100% Lighthouse SEO score.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you're new to TypeScript, don't worry! Next.js allows you to adopt it gradually. Once you're used to it, you will never go back to vanilla JavaScript, I promise!</p>
			<p>Bonus point: if you <a id="_idIndexMarker800"/>feel confident enough, you can also build a simple editing page where users can write their articles and share them on the website.</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you're supposed to follow some strict requirements (the CMS to use, styling methods, and the language). In the next one, you will have complete freedom over any decision regarding the tech stack.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Real-time chat website</h2>
			<p>This is probably one of the most compelling examples of how powerful Next.js can be. For this exercise, you're <a id="_idIndexMarker801"/>required to build a real-time chat application with the following features:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>There must be multiple chat rooms.</li>
				<li>People can join any room by just inserting their name; no login is required.</li>
				<li>When people enter a room, they can access the full chat room history.</li>
				<li>Communication must be in real time.</li>
				<li>Bonus point: allow users to create new chat rooms.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is a fascinating exercise because there are many different things to consider. For example, what if a user knows a given room URL and tries to join without entering their name? Where should all the messages be stored? How can those messages be sent and retrieved in real time?</p>
			<p>To answer these last two questions, there are multiple great products that can help build secure, real-time <a id="_idIndexMarker802"/>software; the most interesting one is undoubtedly Google Firebase. It provides a free real-time database with end-to-end encryption that makes creating any chat app possible with ease.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Next steps</h1>
			<p>In the previous sections, we've seen some tiny ideas that can contain everything you need to practice and enhance your Next.js knowledge.</p>
			<p>Even though we've covered many different topics, there's still so much to learn! But this time, you have all the information you need to bootstrap any Next.js project, and after reading an entire book on the topic, the best way to proceed is by implementing real-world applications.</p>
			<p>From now on, you know how to start a Next.js project from scratch with TypeScript or vanilla JavaScript, how to customize its webpack configuration, how to add any external UI library, how to choose between rendering strategies, where to deploy it, and many other great concepts.</p>
			<p>Next.js is a fast-evolving framework, and the best advice I can give you right now is to follow any news regarding it by following the Next.js core developers and Vercel (and me, <strong class="source-inline">@MicheleRivaCode</strong>, of course!) on Twitter, by <a id="_idIndexMarker803"/>participating in the Next.js Conf (the online event), and by reading the official Next.js blog at <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog">https://nextjs.org/blog</a>.</p>
			<p>You will be surprised to see how fast Next.js moves and transforms the web.</p>
			<p>For that reason, once again, the best thing you can do when you start working with Next.js is to stay informed about its newest releases and features.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This summary marks the end of a book that I wish would never end. Not only because I truly enjoyed writing it, but also because I believe there is so much more to say regarding this beautiful framework.</p>
			<p>This book covered all the essential knowledge needed to code real-world Next.js applications starting from scratch. As a result, I firmly believe you'll feel comfortable writing fast, reliable, and maintainable websites with Next.js, the React framework for production.</p>
			<p>In this specific chapter, we've seen how Next.js is a game-changer in many different situations and how it has transformed the way we write web applications forever. Given that it is an ever-evolving framework, we also discussed how important it is to follow its latest and frequent releases and take advantage of its new features and enhancements.</p>
			<p>We've also seen three real-world applications that we can implement to practice with Next.js, which is an essential part of anyone's journey for learning how to write production-grade applications.</p>
			<p>It's now time to close the book, start coding, and enjoy the time we're living in, where Next.js exists and makes our developer experience just beautiful.</p>
