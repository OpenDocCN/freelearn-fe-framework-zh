<h2 id="_idParaDest-302"><a id="_idTextAnchor301"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Why do you need a good development environment?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">A </span><a id="_idIndexMarker721"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">development environment is an essential part of the software development process for a developer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">A development environment provides an isolated environment in which you can generate and test your code without fear of interfering with a live production environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">This decreases the danger of end user or customer disruptions and allows you to play around with and test different ways of coding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.4">A development environment also allows you to test your source code against many platforms, browsers, and devices to verify that your application works flawlessly for all users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.5">You can write code more effectively, identify mistakes and defects earlier, and ultimately offer a high-quality product to your consumers if you utilize a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">development environment.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">A development environment requires us to have </span><a id="_idIndexMarker722"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">either an </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">integrated development environment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">IDE</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">) or a text editor/code editor. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">But what is the difference between them? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">Let us have </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">a look.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor302"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">What is the difference between an IDE and a text editor/code editor?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">There</span><a id="_idIndexMarker723"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1"> are many ways for us to set up our development environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">Developers, particularly those using JavaScript and React, have a variety of tools to pick from according to their personal needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">An IDE is a popular choice since it includes a full array of tools for developing, debugging, and testing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.4">A text editor, which is a basic tool that enables effective and simplified coding, is another choice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.5">An online code editor, on the other hand, might be the greatest option for those who like to work directly in the browser. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.6">These environments enable quick and easy testing and deployment without the need for any software to be installed on your desktop </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">or laptop.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Now that we have an understanding of these tools, it’s time to move on to learning about the basic steps for setting up a modern React </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">development environment.</span></span></p>

<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">Which tools can we use for scaffolding a React project?</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">We’re certain</span><a id="_idIndexMarker734"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1"> to come across some</span><a id="_idIndexMarker735"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1"> new and intriguing tools and frameworks as we explore the world of web development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">There are a few scaffolding tools that stand out from the rest. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.3">webpack is an open source bundle runner that simplifies the process of bundling code for deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.4">Next.js, Remix, and Gatsby all use webpack. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.5">Then, there’s Babel, a tool that allows us to write in the most recent version of JavaScript and have it compiled into a format that most browsers support. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.6">These technologies work together to provide a seamless and fast scaffolding experience, freeing up our time to focus on providing the greatest possible </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">user experience.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">Scaffolding tools </span><a id="_idIndexMarker736"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">are essential for </span><a id="_idIndexMarker737"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">having a project that is easy to maintain, and we are going to discover why this is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">the case.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">Why are scaffolding tools so important to our project’s success?</span></h3>
