<p class="mce-root">Material-UI is the world's most popular React UI framework. It should come as no surprise that Material-UI skills are a valuable asset to have. There are countless projects in the open source space and in the commercial space that rely on this framework. So, what makes Material-UI so popular?</p>
<p>First and foremost, Material-UI does an excellent job of bringing together two of the best frontend technologies out there. In a nutshell, Material-UI exposes Google's Material Design as components in Facebook's React. Many developers know enough React to build something that works. Many designers know enough about Material Design to design an experience that looks incredible. Material-UI is the bridge between these two worlds, simplifying the task of shipping production applications that delight customers.</p>
<p>At a high level, this sales pitch is enough to intrigue developers at every level and of every specialization. What keeps developers engaged with Material-UI is the breadth of functionality and the depth of resources available to help you tackle any scenario. My hope is that this book serves as a valuable contribution to those resources.</p>

<p>This book is for any developer who thinks that Material-UI could potentially help them produce a better user experience for their application. From seasoned professionals to the junior developers of the world, this book has something to teach you about Material-UI.</p>
<p>No Material Design knowledge is assumed. To get the most out of this book, you should have at least a working knowledge of React and modern JavaScript. While this book isn't meant to teach you React, I do try to explain the React-specific mechanism at work in cases where it might help illuminate the example as a whole.</p>
