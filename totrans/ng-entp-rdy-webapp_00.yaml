- en: Welcome to the wonderful world of web development! This book has been designed to
    teach you the fundamentals of the Angular platform and equip you with useful recipes
    and practical code examples, so you can create rich and scalable line-of-business
    applications. The book emphasizes a minimalist approach, by maximizing the use
    of built-in libraries and avoiding the introduction of additional third-party
    dependencies to achieve the desired outcome. As a result of this approach, your
    code will be easier to maintain and upgrade, as new versions of Angular are released
    frequently. You may continue using this book as a learning resource, as the fundamental
    concepts, technologies, and samples included in the book will remain relevant
    for some time to come, albeit with slight modifications. The tools and services
    recommended in the book have been updated to their latest versions, circa 2020,
    however, tools and services continually evolve, change, and sometimes outright
    disappear. If and when this happens, feel free to reach out to me for alternatives.

- en: This book will also aim to instill an Agile and DevOps mindset in you so that
    you confidently create reliable and flexible solutions. Whether you consider yourself
    a freelancer developing software for small businesses, a full-stack developer,
    an enterprise developer, or a web developer, what you need to know to design,
    architect, develop, maintain, deliver, and deploy a web application, and the best
    practices and patterns you need to apply to achieve those things, don't vary all
    that much. If you are delivering an application to an audience of users, in a
    sense, you are a full-stack developer, since you must be aware of a lot of server
    technologies. In fact, if you master how to deliver Angular applications using
    TypeScript, it won't be difficult for you to write your own RESTful APIs using
    Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript, which is demonstrated through a concrete
    implementation later in the book.

- en: By some definitions, a full-stack developer needs to know everything from catering
    to international copyright law to successfully create and operate an application
    on today's web. If you're an entrepreneur, in a sense, this is true. However,
    in this book, your culinary skills and law degrees need not apply. This book assumes
    that you already know how to work with web development basics and have familiarity
    working with RESTful APIs with the tech stack of your choice, and if not, fear
    not, just follow the hands-on step-by-step instructions and you will be able to
    create your first API-enabled Angular app in no time.

- en: This book is for beginners and experienced developers alike who are looking
    to learn Angular or web development in general. If you are an Angular developer,
    you will be exposed to the entire gamut of designing and deploying an Angular
    application to production. You will learn about Angular patterns that are easy
    to understand and teach others. If you are a freelancer, you will pick up effective
    tools and technologies to deliver your Angular app in a secure, confident, and
    reliable way. If you're an enterprise developer, you will learn patterns and practices
    to write Angular applications with a scalable architecture.
