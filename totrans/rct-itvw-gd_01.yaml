- en: We are now going to talk about the difference between a resume and a cover letter,
    so let’s get started. Essentially, a resume is a form of Word or PDF document
    that basically showcases a person’s work history. This is where you will be presenting
    all of your career experience up to the most recent date. Resumes can cover areas
    of interest such as your education, work experience, achievements, and skills.
    The main purpose of having a resume in the first place is to present your knowledge
    and qualifications to companies for whom you are trying to get hired, in the hopes
    that your profile will be strong enough to get you an interview. The first step
    is always to convince a hiring manager that you are a candidate worth shortlisting.

  zh: 现在，我们将讨论简历和求职信之间的区别，让我们开始吧。本质上，简历是一种 Word 或 PDF 文档，基本上展示了一个人的工作历史。这就是你将展示你截至最近日期的所有职业经验的地方。简历可以涵盖你的兴趣领域，如教育、工作经验、成就和技能。拥有简历的初衷主要是向试图雇佣你的公司展示你的知识和资格，希望你的个人资料足够强大，能让你获得面试机会。第一步始终是说服招聘经理你是一个值得列入候选人名单的候选人。
- en: 'Cover letters, on the other hand, are documents that are no longer than one
    page. Their sole purpose is to accompany your resume, and both are oftentimes
    submitted at the same time for a role. A cover letter is not as formal as a resume,
    meaning that you can be a lot more expressive with your wording here. This is
    your chance to introduce yourself to the company and explain why above all else
    you are the stand-out candidate they should seriously consider hiring. We should
    use cover letters to highlight our best skills and experiences, with the goal
    of ultimately convincing the hiring manager and company that our resume and personality
    make us a potential good culture fit and that we deserve to be invited for an
    interview, at least so that we can prove ourselves. You can find a great example
    of a cover letter in *Figure 1**.1*:'

  zh: 另一方面，求职信是篇幅不超过一页的文件。它们的主要目的是伴随简历使用，并且通常与简历同时提交以申请某个职位。求职信不如简历正式，这意味着你可以在这里用词更加表达自己。这是你向公司介绍自己的机会，并解释为什么你是最值得他们认真考虑雇佣的候选人。我们应该利用求职信来突出我们的最佳技能和经验，目标是最终说服招聘经理和公司，我们的简历和个性使我们成为潜在的文化契合者，并且我们有资格获得面试机会，至少这样我们可以证明自己。你可以在*图

    such as doing job applications. We are going to break this down even further so

- en: When people meet us for the first time, they don’t really know anything about
    us. This essentially gives us a blank canvas where we are able to really sell
    ourselves to a new person and convince them that we are high value and worth getting
    to know. Resumes and cover letters are pretty much the introduction documents
    akin to saying “hi” to someone new or shaking hands when you have met someone
    new whom you would like to know. With well-written documents, we are able to set
    ourselves apart from the other candidates and hopefully put ourselves at the top
    of the shortlist.

  zh: 当人们第一次见到我们时，他们实际上对我们知之甚少。这本质上给了我们一块空白画布，我们可以在上面真正地向新人推销自己，并说服他们我们是有价值且值得了解的。简历和求职信基本上是类似向新人打招呼或与想要了解的新人握手的那种介绍性文件。通过撰写良好的文件，我们能够将自己与其他候选人区分开来，并希望将自己置于候选名单的顶端。
- en: In my experience, you need to be as friendly as possible and go into that interview
    with charisma and as much belief and positivity as you can create. Sometimes,
    it can be hard if, for whatever reason, you are feeling low or bad on the day,
    but you have to find a way to overcome it. I have gone to interviews when I was
    not feeling the greatest, and it negatively impacted the interview. Similarly,
    I have had interviews go well because I was in the right frame of mind on the
    day and knew what I was going to say. A strategy that works well for me is listening
    to music or meditating beforehand. Feeling relaxed or fired up for a challenge
    is really going to give you the strength you need to put your best persona forward
    on the day.

  zh: 根据我的经验，你需要尽可能地友好，带着魅力和尽可能多的信念与积极性去参加面试。有时候，如果你因为任何原因在那天感到情绪低落或不好，那可能会很困难，但你必须找到克服它的方法。我曾经在感觉不是最好的时候去参加面试，这反而影响了面试。同样，我也曾因为那天心态正确，知道要说什么，而面试进行得很顺利。对我来说，一个有效的方法是在面试前听音乐或冥想。感到放松或充满挑战的热情真的会给你提供在那天展示最佳自我的力量。

- en: This is our time to show our potential new employer how good a professional
    we are. Resumes and cover letters are used to screen new candidates to see which
    ones are worth interviewing. If the content we are putting forward is poorly written,
    outdated, fake, or has too many grammatical, spelling, and other inaccuracies,
    then we are highly unlikely to get to the interview stage. In these instances,
    it can be common to experience rejections or even ghosting when you never hear
    back from them. Of course, there are many reasons why this could be happening;
    we just ran through a few scenarios.
  id: totrans-35
  prefs: []

  zh: 这是我们的机会，向潜在的新雇主展示我们有多么优秀。简历和求职信被用来筛选新候选人，看看哪些人值得面试。如果我们提交的内容写得不好、过时、虚假，或者有太多的语法、拼写和其他不准确之处，那么我们几乎不可能进入面试阶段。在这些情况下，可能会遇到拒绝甚至被“幽灵”的情况，即你从未收到他们的回复。当然，这种情况可能有很多原因；我们只是刚刚讨论了几种情况。
- en: I can remember an instance when I had a resume that had some spelling errors
    on it that I did not even notice and nobody mentioned. You would think that the
    spellchecker in Word would show them all, but that was not the case. I had some
    words that were all in capital letters, and the spellchecker did not see the typos.
    That’s why it’s essential that you double- and triple-check what you are writing.
    Even getting someone else to proofread it is a good option. They might spot something
    you missed.

  zh: 我记得有一次，我的简历上有些拼写错误，我甚至没有注意到，也没有人指出。你可能认为Word的拼写检查器会显示所有错误，但事实并非如此。我有一些单词全部是大写字母，拼写检查器没有发现这些错误。这就是为什么你双倍和三倍检查你所写的内容是至关重要的。甚至让其他人帮你校对也是一个好选择。他们可能会发现你遗漏的东西。

    resume and cover letter can increase your job prospects even more. If you create
    a tailor-made resume and cover letter for each role you apply for, then you can
    demonstrate that you have taken the time to read through their job description
    and that you are capable of showcasing how your current technology stack is a
    perfect match for the job. A custom profile is always going to stand out from
    a generic one. Sure—it might take a bit longer to create something custom for
    each application, but if that leads to even a few interviews, then it was clearly
    worth the effort.

  zh: 现在是我们学习定制化的时候了，了解定制简历和求职信如何能进一步增加你的就业机会。如果你为每个申请的职位都创建一个定制的简历和求职信，那么你可以展示你已经花时间阅读了他们的职位描述，并且能够展示你的当前技术栈与工作完美匹配。一个定制的个人资料总是会比通用的个人资料更突出。当然——为每个申请定制内容可能需要更长的时间，但如果这能带来几个面试机会，那么显然这是值得的。
- en: I have had much success with doing this over the years, with my tailor-made
    resumes leading to more interviews compared to the generic ones that I just used
    everywhere. So, let’s say that I am applying for a React role. To better my chances
    of success, I would try to highlight all the React experience that I have. So,
    I would add links to projects that I have created in React either on GitHub or

- en: I could also take this a step further, and for each relevant role I could mention
    something about React, such as—for example—“integrated a Redux store and optimized
    the performance of the application, leading to faster load times for users.” Adding

    eye. Obviously, you should not have any spelling or grammatical errors because
    this can damage your image and credibility. It has to look professional. Bullet
    points tend to be the most effective way to describe each job role. Just break
    them down into points, and describe what you did in the role and how it had a
    positive effect on the business. Avoid writing paragraphs because they will make
    your resume too long, and hiring managers are more likely to avoid them because
    it slows down their shortlisting process. This is advice I received after talking
    to lots of hiring managers and recruiters. Overall, three to four bullet points
    tend to perform the best in this situation.

  zh: 首先，我们的简历格式良好且易于阅读非常重要。显然，你不应该有任何拼写或语法错误，因为这可能会损害你的形象和信誉。它必须看起来专业。项目符号通常是描述每个工作角色的最有效方式。只需将它们分解成要点，并描述你在该角色中所做的工作以及它如何对业务产生积极影响。避免写段落，因为它们会使你的简历过长，而且招聘经理更有可能避免它们，因为它们会减慢他们的筛选过程。这是我在与许多招聘经理和招聘人员交谈后得到的建议。总的来说，在这种情况下，三到四个项目符号通常表现最好。
- en: 'In most scenarios, we will be listing our work experiences in reverse chronological
    order. So, the most recent roles are at the top, and past roles are lower down.
    Keeping our resume updated and with as few gaps as possible is going to help us
    in the long run. To demonstrate our talents and abilities, it is a good idea to
    give particular examples of our successes. To measure our accomplishments, a possible
    solution would be to use figures and percentages to show the gains that we managed
    to achieve during our time working there. Putting in content that is related to
    React is essential because we are applying for React roles, after all. So, the
    more React-related experience that you can put in the experience section, the
    better. In one example, you could show how your experience has advanced. Let’s
    say that you worked on a code base that used the legacy class syntax, and then
    you updated it to use the latest Hooks syntax. That shows that you can work with
    legacy code bases and are familiar with the latest syntax too, and these are great
    traits for a programmer to have: problem-solving and being able to adapt to different
    situations.'

    you have a good chance of getting a message from a hiring manager. I try to have

    volunteer work completed and the degrees we’ve earned. The aim is to determine
    the abilities we applied and the impact we had in each position. There are questions
    that we can ask ourselves, such as how we improved productivity or performance
    and if we completed the project on time and within budget. It’s crucial that we
    list these achievements and any others that we can think of on our resume. Anything
    that makes us credible and an ideal candidate is well worth mentioning. In my
    early days, I listed all the experiences I could think of because this might have
    had some relevance to the job I applied for, such as—for example—if you had a
    job in customer service in retail, which might be a completely different job role

    supplement, not rehash, our resume. Utilize your cover letter to showcase your
    unique examples and talents that make you the strongest applicant for the position.
    Put emphasis on how you can benefit the company, not on what you want in return.
    It is far better to be a giver than a taker because givers provide value, and
    that is a quality worth having in someone. Figuring out which tone of voice to

    we want to work for is doing overall and what its employees think about the company
    in general. I’m sure that we have all at some point in our careers experienced
    what it’s like to work for a bad company that has a toxic work environment. Not
    all companies are going to give you that dream experience, which is why it is
    worth investing some time to do research. It is normal to use websites such as
    Glassdoor when researching a company so that we can see what the feedback and
    reviews are like. It always fills you with hope and excitement when you read positive
    reviews; however, the same isnt true of the negative ones. Even though we all
    want to find that perfect job and are sometimes willing to compromise just to
    get a job offer, we all deserve to be happy in our jobs too. So, do your research
    beforehand.

  zh: 我们应该关注的另一个重要领域是了解我们想要工作的公司整体表现以及其员工对公司的总体看法。我相信我们都在职业生涯的某个时刻经历过在一家有毒的工作环境中工作的糟糕公司的感受。并不是所有公司都会给你带来那种梦想般的体验，这就是为什么花时间进行研究是值得的。在研究公司时使用像Glassdoor这样的网站是正常的，这样我们可以看到反馈和评价是什么样的。阅读积极的评价时，你总是充满希望和兴奋；然而，对于负面的评价则不然。尽管我们都想找到那份完美的职位，有时甚至愿意为了得到一份工作而妥协，但我们都有权在工作中感到快乐。所以，事先做好研究。

- en: I did an internship course, and it taught me how to communicate better. We were
    taught to refrain from using filler words and other language flaws such as *umms*
    and *errs* that could take attention away from our message and degrade our language.
    More practice gives us opportunities to identify any potential areas of weakness

    and well groomed. Make sure your clothing is clean and ironed and that it is appropriate
    for the job you’re looking for. This is true even for video interviews. Even if
    the role is remote, you should still dress like a professional. At the very least,
    dress smart casual just to be safe.

- en: Dressing adequately gives a sense of professionalism that might assist us in
    establishing a solid first impression. In my case, at the very least I shave or
    trim my beard before an interview so that I don’t look unkempt. Getting a haircut
    or a trim is advisable too. These days, we are fortunate because if it’s a video
    interview or phone call, then it’s not too bad. You can get away with looking
    a bit rough. Personally, I would not take that risk with a face-to-face, though;
    wear aftershave or perfume, but not so much that it becomes overwhelming.

  zh: 适当的着装可以给人一种专业的印象，这可能会帮助我们建立良好的第一印象。以我为例，至少在面试前我会刮胡子或修剪胡须，以免看起来不整洁。理发或修剪头发也是推荐的。如今，我们很幸运，因为如果是视频面试或电话，那也还过得去。你可以稍微邋遢一点。不过，我个人不会冒这个风险去面对面的面试；可以喷一点香水或须后水，但不要太多以至于让人感到压抑。

    and capable. Confidence may positively influence the interviewer and boost our
    chances of getting the job. Also, it is a great method to improve conversation
    during the interview. My interviews have had much better conversations when I
    was feeling confident and prepared. It does not always happen straight away, although
    confidence can be increased during the interview. I have found this to be especially
    true when I was able to correctly answer questions and had good responses to other
