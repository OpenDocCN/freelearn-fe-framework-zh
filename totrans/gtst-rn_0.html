And, more importantly, why does the world need yet another approach? Obviously, there must be a problem that hasn't been solved.</p><p>Developers want to use just one language to develop for both iOS and Android. Web developers want to reuse their existing JavaScript knowledge and leverage the web frameworks they already know and love. This is why Apache Cordova (PhoneGap) exists.  By wrapping a web browser in a native app, developers can package their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript applications in a native shell, but why aren't all mobile applications based on Cordova?</p><p>Users expect native performance, with a native user experience. Hybrid apps don't solve the user's problems, they solve the developer's problems. We need a technology that can do both!</p><p>React Native changes the game with applications that are truly native. It doesn't use a WebView or transpile JavaScript to native languages. Think of it as native UI components being controlled by a JavaScript brain. The result is a user experience that is indistinguishable from any other native app, and a developer experience that leverages the amazing productivity benefits of JavaScript and the React framework.</p><p>Armed with React Native, you'll finally be able to leverage your web development skills in the mobile world without sacrificing quality or performance. It's the Holy Grail, and we're excited to show you what React Native can do and to see what amazing apps you create with it!</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
