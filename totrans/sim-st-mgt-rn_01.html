<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">The predecessors</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">Did you know that the first website ever created is still live? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">You can find it here: </span><a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">It was created in 1991! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">A lot has changed since then. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.4">For starters, web developers wanted to change their websites’ appearance, hence CSS was created. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.5">A few years later those same web developers wanted to see more interactivity on their now beautiful websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.6">This is when </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">JavaScript</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1"> found </span><a id="_idIndexMarker001"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">its place on the internet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">But as we know, the web never stops evolving. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">Heavy usage of JavaScript led to the creation of libraries such as jQuery, BackboneJS, and Ember. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.4">Each library’s creators learned lessons from their competitors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.5">They made decisions that led to creating very different developer experiences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.6">The developers had their preferences and little wars over which library </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">is better.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">There is no right answer to this question. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">What is certain, however, is that user experience on websites evolved, no matter which library was used behind the scenes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">Websites became much more interactive and adaptable to the user’s screen size. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.4">For example, it is common practice today to create separate menus for mobile views and desktop views. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.5">This can be achieved with JavaScript, or CSS alone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.6">This user experience shift could not take place without the evolution of JavaScript </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">open </span></strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">source</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1"> libraries.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">After a few years of adding more and more separate bits of JavaScript to websites, it was time for a more holistic solution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">The first breakthrough came from Google, with </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">AngularJS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">AngularJS, officially </span><a id="_idIndexMarker002"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">released in 2010, was different from other solutions on the market at that time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">This was not just another library; this was a framework. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.3">Developers were able to create complex interactions quickly, and they were no longer afraid that any change to their JavaScript files could break the entire page. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.4">I don’t want to go into the implementational details of AngularJS. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.5">After all, that is not the focus of this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.6">In broad strokes, AngularJS introduced special HTML attributes that were observed by the framework running in the background. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.7">As you may imagine, when JavaScript is observing dozens or even hundreds of elements and events, it will slow down. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.8">So, the user experience is suffering, and the world is ready for another JavaScript revolution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.9">Google thought they would remain king of the hill with their Angular version 2, but in 2013, Facebook developers announced the release </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">of ReactJS.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">And then there was React</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">ReactJS </span><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">was presented specifically as</span><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1"> a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">user interface</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">UI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">) library. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">It was conceived to be used for end user interactions on websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.3">It also used </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">JSX</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1"> – an</span><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1"> extension to JavaScript created for React. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">Many developers reacted, pun intended, angrily to this new syntax. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">I would say though, that angry reactions are not unexpected in the world of tech. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.4">Any new technological solution has to weather the storm of angry Reddit posts saying that it’s ugly, useless, or simply terrible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.5">Luckily for us, ReactJS developers did not stop working on their open source framework because of this initial negative reaction. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.6">Furthermore, developers who got to know ReactJS became its advocates. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.7">Why, you may ask, did ReactJS stand the test of time, while Angular hasn’t? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.8">I believe it has to do with the high-level mindset of the framework. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.9">ReactJS proposes elegant, simple solutions while staying completely configurable to any needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.10">I will go further into this mindset idea in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">next section.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Going back to our history lesson! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">We’re in 2013, and ReactJS has entered the scene with a bang. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">Many people hate it, but others use it for more and more complex websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">And it turns out, unfortunately, that ReactJS does not scale well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.5">Your React components use state and props. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.6">If the parent creates a state, which needs to be read four to five components lower in the hierarchy, you encounter something that is dubbed </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">prop drilling</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">Prop drilling</span><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1"> means that the developer has to pass the necessary prop through many parent components in order to get to the final child that needs to read it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">This process is irritating and boring, at the same time! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.3">This is when the first state management library was </span><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">created – </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Redux</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">We will talk in detail about Redux and other state management libraries in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">next chapters.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">As of writing this book, ReactJS is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">It evolves constantly, and its maintainers are open to public discussions and suggestions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">In 2019, they introduced hooks and context. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.4">These two React utilities can cover a lot of your state management needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.5">They were created because the React team realized that developers using React needed an improvement in the state </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">management area.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">A few years before the introduction of hooks and context, specifically in 2015, Facebook developers released React Native. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">The true hero of this book! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.3">But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.4">At this moment, it is important that you understand the basic concepts of React. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.5">Let’s move on to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">React mindset.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">Let’s try and capture the most important, and still relevant, parts of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">that article.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">First of all, when we create a website with ReactJS, we need to think about how we will construct our components. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">Not HTML blocks, not DOM elements, but components. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.3">Ideally, each component will be a separate entity, which either creates a state or consumes props, or sometimes both. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.4">The component is the smallest part of our app, just like atoms are the smallest parts of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">our world.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">Okay, I realize atoms can be further divided into neutrons, protons, and electrons. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">And </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">ReactJS components</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1"> can be </span><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">divided into parts that handle the logic and the actual rendering. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">However, both atoms and ReactJS components are the basic building blocks in their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">respective realms.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">Now that we have our components imagined, we need to know how they should interact with each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">Let’s go back to the ReactJS docs, where we will find a great chapter, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">Composition vs. </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">Inheritance</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">: </span></span><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html"><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html</span></span></a><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">This article is very clear in stating that ReactJS components should be composed, and not stacked in a strict hierarchy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">This basically means that any child component should be created in a way that it could be reused by other parent components throughout the app. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.3">This promotes the high reusability of atomic components, and at the same time, reduces the amount of code needed to create </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">an application.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">Now that we have the theory down, let’s move on to specifics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">How do we compose ReactJS components in practice? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.3">By using state and props. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.4">What are those, you may ask? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.5">Well, I’ll be glad </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">to explain!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">Both </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">state</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1"> and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">props</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1"> (short for properties) are plain JavaScript objects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">The big difference</span><a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1"> between them is that</span><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1"> props are read-only, while state can be changed within </span><a id="_idIndexMarker012"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">the component that manages it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">State is the source of truth, while props are the representations of the current state of the application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.3">Let’s take a look at a minimal </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">code example:</span></span></p>
