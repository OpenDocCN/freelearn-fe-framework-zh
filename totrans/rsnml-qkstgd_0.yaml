- en: ReactJS has changed the world of frontend development as we know it. Its creator,
    Jordan Walke, also created ReasonML and ReasonReact as the future of React. React's
    abstraction of the DOM allows for powerful programming paradigms that help solve
    JavaScript's maintainability problem, and in this book, we dive into exactly how
    Reason can help you build simpler, more maintainable React applications. This
    book is a hands-on guide to building React applications with ReasonML.
