    As more and more data becomes available, it becomes necessary to process the data
    and present insights extracted from this data in meaningful and appealing visualizations
    to end users. In this chapter, we will learn how to use MERN stack technologies
    along with Victory—a charting library for React—to easily integrate data visualization
    features in a full-stack application. We will extend the MERN skeleton application
    to build an expense tracking application, which will incorporate data processing
    and visualization features for expense data recorded by a user over time.

    After the user authentication is confirmed, in the `listByUser` controller method

    query against the Expense collection using these values will return matching expenses
    sorted by the `incurred_on` field, with the recently incurred expenses listed

    in the specified year and recorded by the authenticated user while aggregating
