<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Finding a career that fits your abilities, interests, and objectives can be difficult in today’s ever-changing employment environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">It’s essential to devote time and energy to perfecting the art of interview preparation if you want to stand out from the crowd and obtain your ideal job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">This chapter acts as your full road map, equipping you to confidently navigate the way to your next professional opportunity by providing useful guidance and essential insights into each stage of the interview process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">In the next chapters, we are going to explore common interview questions for React developers as we get ourselves job-ready for working in this industry as JavaScript developers skilled in using the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">React framework.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">As we go on an actual job hunt, we look at a number of resources to find chances, including LinkedIn, meetings, and referrals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">We go through methods for utilizing your professional network, enhancing your internet profile, and accessing the untapped job market so that you have the knowledge and resources necessary to find a wide range of opportunities and develop enduring relationships. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">In this chapter, we will start by talking about your resume and cover letter, which are the foundation of your job application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">These crucial records give prospective employers a summary of your qualifications and a look into your professional demeanor. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.5">To capture the hiring manager’s interest, we go into detail on creating appealing content, customizing your resume and cover letter to the job's needs, and improving their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">overall presentation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Because we will be applying for React roles, it’s important that we tailor our resume appropriately so that it gives us the best chance of getting our resume in front of a hiring manager’s eyes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">This can be achieved by including relevant buzzwords such as </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">React</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Redux</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">, and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">Next.js</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">, which are all related to the React ecosystem, strengthening our profile further as it becomes apparent that we are a candidate worth checking out due to the fact that we use the tools and technologies they most likely have on their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">job descriptions.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">We will be going </span><a id="_idIndexMarker000"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">through the process of creating a good resume and cover letter in this section, which is essential if you want to give yourself the best possible chance of doing well during the interview stage of your job search as a React developer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">This is an area that can essentially have a big impact on whether or not you find yourself in a position where you have a constant stream of job opportunities coming your way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">Having a good resume combined with an equally good cover letter is the first step to covering all of your bases—so to speak—by preparing you for any challenging outcome you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">might encounter.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">We are now </span><a id="_idIndexMarker001"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">going to talk about the difference between a resume and a cover letter, so let’s get started. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">Essentially, a resume is a form of Word or PDF document that basically showcases a person’s work history. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">This is where you will be presenting all of your career experience up to the most recent date. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.4">Resumes can cover areas of interest such as your education, work experience, achievements, and skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.5">The main purpose of having a resume in the first place is to present your knowledge and qualifications to companies for whom you are trying to get hired, in the hopes that your profile will be strong enough to get you an interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.6">The first step is always to convince a hiring manager that you are a candidate </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">worth shortlisting.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Cover letters, on the other hand, are documents that are no longer than one page. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">Their sole purpose is to accompany your resume, and both are oftentimes submitted at the same time for a role. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">A cover letter is not as formal as a resume, meaning that you can be a lot more expressive with your wording here. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.4">This is your chance to introduce yourself to the company and explain why above all else you are the stand-out candidate they should seriously consider hiring. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.5">We should use cover letters to highlight our best skills and experiences, with the goal of ultimately convincing the hiring manager and company that our resume and personality make us a potential good culture fit and that we deserve to be invited for an interview, at least so that we can prove ourselves. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.6">You can find a great example of a cover letter in </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Figure 1</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">.1</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">Let’s now discuss the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker002"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1"> importance of having a good resume and cover letter and why they are essential for job searchers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">It is far too easy to believe that you can make do with just a generic resume, believing that it is not a high priority and that your time would be better spent on other areas of the job search process such as doing job applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.3">We are going to break this down even further so that we can highlight the areas where having a stand-out resume and cover letter can work in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">your favor.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">To do that, we will navigate the importance of making a good first impression, learn how to pass the screening process, understand which customizations to look into, learn how to sell your brand, and learn how to train yourself to go into an interview </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">with confidence.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">How to make a good first impression</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">When people meet</span><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1"> us for the first time, they don’t really know anything about us. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">This essentially gives us a blank canvas where we are able to really sell ourselves to a new person and convince them that we are high value and worth getting to know. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">Resumes and cover letters are pretty much the introduction documents akin to saying “hi” to someone new or shaking hands when you have met someone new whom you would like to know. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.4">With well-written documents, we are able to set ourselves apart from the other candidates and hopefully put ourselves at the top of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">the shortlist.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">In my experience, you need to be as friendly as possible and go into that interview with charisma and as much belief and positivity as you can create. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">Sometimes, it can be hard if, for whatever reason, you are feeling low or bad on the day, but you have to find a way to overcome it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.3">I have gone to interviews when I was not feeling the greatest, and it negatively impacted the interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.4">Similarly, I have had interviews go well because I was in the right frame of mind on the day and knew what I was going to say. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.5">A strategy that works well for me is listening to music or meditating beforehand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.6">Feeling relaxed or fired up for a challenge is</span><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1"> really going to give you the strength you need to put your best persona forward on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">the day.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Passing the screening process</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">This is our time to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">show our potential new employer how good a professional we are. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">Resumes and cover letters are used to screen new candidates to see which ones are worth interviewing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">If the content we are putting forward is poorly written, outdated, fake, or has too many grammatical, spelling, and other inaccuracies, then we are highly unlikely to get to the interview stage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.4">In these instances, it can be common to experience rejections or even ghosting when you never hear back from them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.5">Of course, there are many reasons why this could be happening; we just ran through a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">few scenarios.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">I can remember an instance when I had a resume that had some spelling errors on it that I did not even notice and nobody mentioned. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">You would think that the spellchecker in Word would show them all, but that was not the case. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">I had some words that were all in capital letters, and the spellchecker did not see the typos. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">That’s why it’s essential that you double- and triple-check what you are writing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.5">Even getting someone else to proofread it is a good option. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.6">They might spot something </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">you missed.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Customizing your resume and cover letter</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">It’s now time for us</span><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1"> to learn about customizations and how having a tailor-made resume and cover letter can increase your job prospects even more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">If you create a tailor-made resume and cover letter for each role you apply for, then you can demonstrate that you have taken the time to read through their job description and that you are capable of showcasing how your current technology stack is a perfect match for the job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">A custom profile is always going to stand out from a generic one. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.4">Sure—it might take a bit longer to create something custom for each application, but if that leads to even a few interviews, then it was clearly worth </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">the effort.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">I have had much success with doing this over the years, with my tailor-made resumes leading to more interviews compared to the generic ones that I just used everywhere. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">So, let’s say that I am applying for a React role. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">To better my chances of success, I would try to highlight all the React experience that I have. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.4">So, I would add links to projects that I have created in React either on GitHub or a live website. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.5">I am also a technical writer, so adding links to articles on React that I have published would help me stand out </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">even more.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">I could also take this a step further, and for each relevant role I could mention something about React, such as—for example—“integrated a Redux store and optimized the performance of the application, leading to faster load times for users.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">Adding in keywords such as </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Next.js</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">Vercel</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">Netlify</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">AWS</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">, and other technologies will improve our profile </span><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">further because it shows that we are well versed in modern </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">technical stacks.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Selling your brand</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">We are brands. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">This is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker008"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">an important concept that should be realized as we walk through life. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">Every time we meet somebody new, we have a chance to forge a new connection that can open up doors to even more life experiences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.3">We use resumes and cover letters for marketing purposes because we are essentially selling ourselves and our ethos to new people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.4">This gives us the chance to highlight our experiences, life achievements, and technical abilities, which are very hard to gauge from a normal </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">job application.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">This realization has led to me applying this mindset to everything in my life. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">Whether that is the content I create on social media or the emails that I send to clients, it’s all about having this brand and business professional ethos. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.3">People are more likely to believe in you if you can prove that you are a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">credible person.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">Going in with confidence</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">When we put in the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1"> time and effort to create a well-made resume and cover letter, it can do wonders for our confidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">The more confidence you can show at the start, the higher the likelihood that you are going to perform well in the interviews. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.3">It really does make a difference when we go into something high on confidence, as opposed to feeling negative and downbeat. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.4">We attract what we put out into the world. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.5">The more positivity we can output, the more positivity that will come back </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">our way.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">I can’t think of many successful interviews I had when I went there downbeat and lacking confidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">People can really pick up on this energy, which is why it’s so important to be in the right frame of mind prior to going for that interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.3">There have been times when I was feeling low after facing multiple rejections and ghosting experiences, which happens to all of us. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.4">In those situations, it’s probably best to take a break from interviews, which is what I forced myself to do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.5">The confidence will return over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.6">If you are getting burnt out, as I did, take </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">a break.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">In the next section, we </span><a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">will learn about the different types of resumes that we can create. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">Every job is different, so it’s important to learn about the variety of resumes that we have available to us and which ones are the most appropriate for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">each job.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">It is critical to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">select a resume format that best emphasizes your talents and experiences and is relevant to the position you are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">looking for.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">There are several varieties of resumes, such as chronological, functional, combination, targeted, and creative. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">Each one serves a different purpose. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.3">We are going to learn about the differences between them so that we can factor this in when it is time to create </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">our own.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">Moving on, in the next section, let’s figure out some key elements of a good resume. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">It’s one thing knowing how to create a resume, but if we really want it to stand out from the crowd, then it’s</span><a id="_idIndexMarker030"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1"> important</span><a id="_idIndexMarker031"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1"> that we make it effective for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">our needs.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">Key elements of a good resume</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">No resume is ever</span><a id="_idIndexMarker032"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1"> created equally, and although it can be common for resumes to be similar, it is well within our means to create a resume that can give us an advantage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.2">We will now learn about some key elements that can help us make them </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">less generic.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">Firstly, it’s important that our resumes are well formatted and easy on the eye. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.2">Obviously, you should not have any spelling or grammatical errors because this can damage your image and credibility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.3">It has to look professional. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.4">Bullet points tend to be the most effective way to describe each job role. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.5">Just break them down into points, and describe what you did in the role and how it had a positive effect on the business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.6">Avoid writing paragraphs because they will make your resume too long, and hiring managers are more likely to avoid them because it slows down their shortlisting process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.7">This is advice I received after talking to lots of hiring managers and recruiters. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.8">Overall, three to four bullet points tend to perform the best in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">this situation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">In most scenarios, we will be listing our work experiences in reverse chronological order. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.2">So, the most recent roles are at the top, and past roles are lower down. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.3">Keeping our resume updated and with as few gaps as possible is going to help us in the long run. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.4">To demonstrate our talents and abilities, it is a good idea to give particular examples of our successes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.5">To measure our accomplishments, a possible solution would be to use figures and percentages to show the gains that we managed to achieve during our time working there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.6">Putting in content that is related to React is essential because we are applying for React roles, after all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.7">So, the more React-related experience that you can put in the experience section, the better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.8">In one example, you could show how your experience has advanced. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.9">Let’s say that you worked on a code base that used the legacy class syntax, and then you updated it to use the latest Hooks syntax. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.10">That shows that you can work with legacy code bases and are familiar with the latest syntax too, and these are great traits for a programmer to have: problem-solving and being able to adapt to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">different situations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">The section on education should show our qualifications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.2">So, any college or university degrees that we hold should be presented there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.3">Mentioning any certifications, courses, and training can add further weight to our profile. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.4">When it comes to the skills section, it’s best to include both hard and soft skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.5">Hard skills include programming-related areas such as JavaScript, React, and Node.js. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.6">Soft skills, on the other hand, include areas such as communication, teamwork, proactiveness, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">so on.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">Lastly, ensure that your resume is effectively tailored for the job and use keywords that highlight your skills and experiences in relation to the job that you are applying for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.2">Many companies </span><a id="_idIndexMarker033"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">use </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">applicant tracking system</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">ATS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">) resume scanner tools for finding candidates. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.2">So, if you can put in keywords such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which could also be on their job description, then you have a good chance of getting a message from a hiring manager. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.3">I try to have as many keywords as possible in mine because you never know—it could</span><a id="_idIndexMarker034"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1"> make all the difference and determine if you are one of the candidates who </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">gets shortlisted.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">So, we just learned about the key elements of a good resume. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.2">The next step will be to do the same for cover letters </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">as well.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">Key elements of a good cover letter</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">Cover letters let us express </span><a id="_idIndexMarker035"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">ourselves in a more informal way, which is usually not a possibility on a resume, which has to be more formal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">Let’s explore some areas for writing good cover letters. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.3">The aim here should be to have good engagement, so have a strong fun introduction that briefly explains who you are, what you can do, and why you are applying for the role at that company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.4">Don’t forget to mention the company name and the job title on the job description </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">you saw.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">Start strong and highlight your best skills and experiences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.2">Use as much charisma as possible to engage with the person who is going to be reading it, and try to write in a relaxed manner. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.3">All of this will show that you are a good fit for the role. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.4">Use this time to make it as personal as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.5">Through this, we can show how well we have researched the company by showing lots of passion and motivation for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">the work.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">With all of that out of the way, we should be ready to end the cover letter by requesting an interview or indicating your readiness to share more details. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.2">With these points, we can produce a strong and successful cover letter by adding these important aspects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.3">When I write cover letters, my aim is to make them intriguing, engaging, and social. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.4">I work toward trying to captivate the reader so that they can imagine what it would be like to work with me. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.5">You can have the best programming skills in the world, but at some point, you will have to interact with people, so it’s an area that needs to be worked on as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.6">A good combination of hard and soft skills is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">most desirable.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">Cover letters give us significantly more creative freedom when compared to resumes, which are far stricter in terms of the structure that we use for them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.2">Broadly speaking, it is like writing a letter or an email and selling our skills, brand, and personality to a potential new company that is looking for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">new hires.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">Typically, we could be covering topics such as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">An introduction</span></span></li>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">These are some examples of content recommended to be included when writing a cover letter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.2">A quick Google search for cover letter templates provides many examples and different ways to write one. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.3">Essentially, all you are doing is writing a letter on why you are a good candidate for this role, and this does not usually require a template; we can pretty much just make do with a good piece of writing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.4">However, if you want to use a template, then feel free to do so if you think it will work </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">for you.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">We are making really good progress, so let’s continue our journey. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.2">Our job search can be improved further, and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker037"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">all it takes is for us to have an in-depth look at the job descriptions we see out there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.2">In this next section, we will learn why it’s a good idea to examine job </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1">descriptions thoroughly.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">The better we get at </span><a id="_idIndexMarker038"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">reading job descriptions, the more likely we are to apply for the most suitable roles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.2">In this section, we will walk through some key steps that are going to make our lives so much easier when it comes to looking for our </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">next role.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">When you search and find a job description, take your time and read through the whole thing from top to bottom. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.2">A job description is like a brief for a project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.3">Go through it to ensure that you know exactly what is needed and don’t miss anything. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.4">Look for areas that mention qualifications, education, skills, experience, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.5">You don’t always need to meet all the specifications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.6">In fact, it’s quite common for people to get hired even when they don’t possess all of the skills and experience, which has happened to me many times. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.7">Job descriptions are like guidelines; oftentimes, the winning candidate does not have everything required but is more than capable of learning on the job or in their free time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.8">Keep a look out for those ATS keywords because the more of them that you find, the better your chances of getting to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">an interview.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">Other areas of interest that we have to pay close attention to are the work, location, and salary. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.2">These factors are related to work-life balance, and if we want to have a healthy mental state, then they need serious consideration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.3">The better these are, the higher the likelihood that we can perform well on the job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.4">You can maximize your chances of receiving an interview call and eventually being hired by carefully reviewing job descriptions and adapting your application to the individual position </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">and organization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">We have to use every</span><a id="_idIndexMarker039"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1"> asset at our disposal to find work, which is why there has to be an emphasis on identifying our key skills and accomplishments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.2">Let’s now see how this can be a great way to boost </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">our profile.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">Identifying key skills and accomplishments</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">We should create</span><a id="_idIndexMarker040"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1"> a list of the jobs we have held under a titled section of </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">Work History</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">Work Experience</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">, or something similar. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.2">This section should include volunteer work completed and the degrees we’ve earned. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.3">The aim is to determine the abilities we applied and the impact we had in each position. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.4">There are questions that we can ask ourselves, such as how we improved productivity or performance and if we completed the project on time and within budget. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.5">It’s crucial that we list these achievements and any others that we can think of on our resume. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.6">Anything that makes us credible and an ideal candidate is well worth mentioning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.7">In my early days, I listed all the experiences I could think of because this might have had some relevance to the job I applied for, such as—for example—if you had a job in customer service in retail, which might be a completely different job role from the one you’re applying for now, but it is evidence that you can negotiate and talk </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">to clients.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">Creating a resume is not that difficult; however, it can be all too easy to make mistakes that you might not even realize unless someone points them out. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.2">We will now learn about some</span><a id="_idIndexMarker041"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1"> common resume mistakes </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">to avoid.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">Common resume mistakes to avoid</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">Probably the top</span><a id="_idIndexMarker042"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1"> concern that we have to be aware of is spelling and grammatical mistakes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.2">Always proofread your resume a couple of times because giving it multiple pass-throughs improves the chances of you not missing something important. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.3">Use a spellchecker, and it is even better if you can use a tool such as Grammarly, which is a very effective and professional </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">copywriting tool.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">Removing non-essential information is going to work well in our favor too, such as with an introduction paragraph that explains who we are and what we are looking for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.2">This belongs on the cover letter, not the resume. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.3">And any section that talks about our personal hobbies can be removed too because it is not required for the job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.4">If they want to know what you do in your spare time, they can ask you at an interview, and in this situation, it becomes more appropriate, especially if it’s a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">culture-fit interview.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">I know it’s probably obvious, but still, people skip this step or don’t take it seriously at all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.2">I am talking about researching the company you have sent your resume to. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.3">We like to focus on answering interview questions because, let’s be honest, we can do hundreds of job applications, and nobody is going to learn about every company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.4">Our main goal is to find a job, and that’s why we send our resume out everywhere. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.5">Nonetheless, if that company invites us for an interview, at the very least, we should know something </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">about them.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">Let’s see why this is essential in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">next section.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">Researching the company</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">Always research the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker043"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">company by going to their website. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">Don’t make the mistake of going to an interview with only generic interview questions and knowledge at hand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.3">It is not uncommon for interviewers to ask you what you know about the company, so don’t expect it to be all coding questions related to React because you never know on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">the day.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">Learn about the work they do, their clients, their technical stack, and their history—basically, everything—and you can use search engines such as Google to learn even more about them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.2">I have made this mistake so many times over the years. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.3">I can recall one interview where one of the interviewers asked me what I knew about the company, and I tried to avoid answering because I knew nothing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.4">I was super prepared for any programming-related questions because that was a weakness that I wanted to fix. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.5">I did not think that it was worth the time to gain deep insights into the company because—let’s be honest here—the first-stage interview might not go anywhere, and then you will feel like you wasted your time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.6">However, it has to be done on the off chance that you do get asked, and your failure to come up with an answer gets you removed from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">the shortlist.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">We have covered</span><a id="_idIndexMarker044"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1"> resume mistakes, so now, we will do the same for cover letters too because these are equally important. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.2">So, on to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">next section.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1">Common cover letter mistakes to avoid</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">Putting together a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker045"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1"> great cover letter is an excellent way to take our job profile to another level, yet it is also an area that many people tend to let themselves down in by not taking the time to do it properly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.2">It should not be seen as an optional addition to a resume but as a document that should be submitted alongside it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.3">They are like two sides of the same coin and complement </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">each other.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">By far one of the biggest mistakes we can make is using a generic template. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.2">Utilizing a generic cover letter template can give the impression that we didn’t take the time to customize our application for the particular position. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.3">Instead, adjust your cover letter to the position you’re seeking; this is how it should always </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">be done.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">Another area to be concerned about is duplication. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.2">Our cover letters should supplement, not rehash, our resume. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.3">Utilize your cover letter to showcase your unique examples and talents that make you the strongest applicant for the position. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.4">Put emphasis on how you can benefit the company, not on what you want in return. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.5">It is far better to be a giver than a taker because givers provide value, and that is a quality worth having in someone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.6">Figuring out which tone of voice to use when you write can be challenging as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.7">Work on matching the way the company comes across; striking the right balance between formal and informal </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">is important.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">We are learning so much about resumes and cover letters, which is going to help us a great deal when it comes to applying for those React roles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.2">It’s time to tackle the subject of GitHub and portfolios. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.3">Our resumes and cover letters can get us in front of hiring managers, but ultimately, it is the projects and skills that we possess that are highly likely to get us interviews. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.4">In this upcoming section, we will learn about GitHub profiles and portfolios and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker046"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">why we should </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">utilize them.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">Throughout the years, I have managed to get interviews solely based on my portfolio website, through its design, content and details of work I have done over the years. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.2">Our resumes and cover letters can look almost identical to a hiring manager’s eyes after they have gone through a dozen of them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.3">However, having a custom portfolio and GitHub home page can become eye candy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.4">It has worked for me, and it can work for you in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">same way.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">Creating a website </span><a id="_idIndexMarker048"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">portfolio or GitHub profile might help you find work and stand out throughout the hiring process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.2">These not only highlight your abilities, but they also show that you can cooperate with others, use tools effectively, and handle challenging situations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.3">Also, they provide potential employers with a more thorough picture of your coding experience and skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.4">Making an eye-catching profile or portfolio might be crucial in differentiating oneself from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">the competition.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">A solid GitHub profile </span><a id="_idIndexMarker052"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">and website </span><a id="_idIndexMarker053"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">portfolio might be a terrific approach to stand out to interviewers while trying to secure your ideal job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.2">So, why not make your application stand out from the competition with an inventive portfolio? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.3">We can set ourselves apart from the competition by providing instances of how we push the envelope with our code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.4">Interviewers can see that we have unique ideas, even from initiatives that were abandoned or never used. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.5">We should not undervalue the impact of demonstrating unconventional solutions, even if they weren’t used. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.6">Employers will be impressed by our diligence </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">and inventiveness.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">For example, it is a well-known fact that everyone tries to build a to do app when trying to showcase their skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.2">It has become so generic because it does not make us any different from each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.3">It’s hard to choose between candidates when they are almost all carbon copies of each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.4">In my opinion, a better solution would be to have projects on your GitHub or portfolio that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">show progression.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">So, you could start with a basic React application that has some simple business logic of some sort—so, perhaps, a calculator—and then, you could create a more advanced React application that could have multiple features that do different things, such as having some CRUD functionality, or a store if we are building an e-commerce application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.2">Afterward, we could take it a step further, maybe adding an authentication layer with login and logout, GraphQL, and various microservices all interacting with each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.3">This shows a clear progression as your skills continue to evolve and the projects become even </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">more complex.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.1">Personally, I have encountered all of these throughout my career. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.2">If you are extremely lucky, you might not have to do anything extremely technical because maybe the company that is hiring you does not believe in doing these types of code assessments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.3">That’s a possibility, and I have interviewed with companies who thought that way, but it’s not always a guarantee. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.4">So, always be prepared no matter what. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.5">In terms of preparation, what I would do is work on my technical stack as much as possible—so, essentially, write as much code as I can and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.491.1">build apps.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.1">For example, you might be applying for frontend or full stack jobs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.2">So, what I have done in these situations is just practice building </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.493.1">create, read, update, delete</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.1">CRUD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.496.1">) applications that connect to a database with a React frontend, and then taking it a step further and integrating third-party libraries such as Day.js, which is used for converting dates, or a chart library such as recharts.js, which is used for data visualization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.496.2">These are tools that get used in real-world projects, so learning them now makes you better prepared for those take-home code challenges that could require you to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.1">use them.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.1">Doing this step will give you more confidence in your programming skills for your technical stack. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.2">The other area that you should work on is data structures and algorithms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.3">There are courses that you can do on Udemy, or you can study this subject elsewhere. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.4">Next, you have to find the time to practice online on coding platforms such as LeetCode. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.5">It can be tedious, but unfortunately, we need to be prepared for anything. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.6">On some job boards, I have seen forms that ask you how prepared you are for a code test, which is part of the application process when you are submitting your resume. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.7">And I can imagine that if you say that you are not that prepared, then you might not even make the shortlist. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.8">So, the moral of the story: get yourself to a place where you feel you are confident </span><a id="_idIndexMarker084"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.1">enough to at least attempt doing a code test. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.2">It’s impossible to be 100% ready because there are so many different variables to take into account. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.3">At the very least, we should be prepared enough to give it a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.1">good go.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.1">Researching the company</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.1">It is critical to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker085"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.1"> conduct research about the organization and position we are looking for prior to our interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.2">Browse the company’s website and read any relevant news releases or articles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.3">Prepare a list of questions related to the material you discover ahead of time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.4">This can assist potential employers in seeing our interest and expertise in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.1">the industry.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.1">As job seekers, we can exhibit genuine interest in the organization and the position we are seeking by studying it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.2">It demonstrates that they are taking the interview seriously and are prepared to put in the time and effort to prepare. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.3">I have found that I can adjust my replies to the individual job and business culture by researching the company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.4">It enabled me to comprehend the company’s beliefs, goals, and mission, as well as to tailor my </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.1">replies accordingly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.1">Another important area that we should pay attention to is seeing how a company we want to work for is doing overall and what its employees think about the company in general. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.2">I’m sure that we have all at some point in our careers experienced what it’s like to work for a bad company that has a toxic work environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.3">Not all companies are going to give you that dream experience, which is why it is worth investing some time to do research. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.4">It is normal to use websites such as Glassdoor when researching a company so that we can see what the feedback and reviews are like. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.5">It always fills you with hope and excitement when you read positive reviews; however, the same isnt true of the negative ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.6">Even though we all want to find that perfect job and are sometimes willing to compromise </span><a id="_idIndexMarker086"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.1">just to get a job offer, we all deserve to be happy in our jobs too. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.2">So, do your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.1">research beforehand.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.1">Practicing your questions and answers</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.1">An excellent interview</span><a id="_idIndexMarker087"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.1"> tip is to practice answering questions ahead of time so that you feel more at ease and confident while replying during the interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.2">Consider probable questions, and practice your replies with a friend or family member. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.3">These days, it’s normal to have video interviews as well as phone calls. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.4">So, find a way to get some practice with this too. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.5">If you don’t have anyone to practice with, you can always record yourself, watch it back, and work </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.1">on improvements.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.1">I did an internship course, and it taught me how to communicate better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.2">We were taught to refrain from using filler words and other language flaws such as </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.1">umms</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.1"> and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.1">errs</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.1"> that could take attention away from our message and degrade our language. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.2">More practice gives us opportunities to identify any potential areas of weakness we </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.1">may have.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.1">Dressing appropriately</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1">When it comes to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker088"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1"> interviewing attire, it is critical to look tidy, professional, and well groomed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.2">Make sure your clothing is clean and ironed and that it is appropriate for the job you’re looking for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.3">This is true even for video interviews. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.4">Even if the role is remote, you should still dress like a professional. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.5">At the very least, dress smart casual just to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1">be safe.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1">Dressing adequately gives a sense of professionalism that might assist us in establishing a solid first impression. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.2">In my case, at the very least I shave or trim my beard before an interview so that I don’t look unkempt. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.3">Getting a haircut or a trim is advisable too. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.4">These days, we are fortunate because if it’s a video interview or phone call, then it’s not too bad. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.5">You can get away with looking a bit rough. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.6">Personally, I would not take that risk with a face-to-face, though; wear aftershave or perfume, but not so much that it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1">becomes overwhelming.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1">Being confident</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.1">Attitude is everything</span><a id="_idIndexMarker089"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.1"> when it comes to interviewing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.2">I try to work toward having a good attitude and excitement for the position I’m looking for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.3">While responding to queries from possible employers, make sure to create good eye contact, smile frequently, and offer clear concise responses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.4">This shows that we are self-assured and capable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.5">Confidence may positively influence the interviewer and boost our chances of getting the job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.6">Also, it is a great method to improve conversation during the interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.7">My interviews have had much better conversations when I was feeling confident and prepared. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.8">It does not always happen straight away, although confidence can be increased during the interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.9">I have found this to be especially true when I was able to correctly answer questions and had good responses to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.1">other ones.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.1">Following up after the interview</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.1">Remember to express </span><a id="_idIndexMarker090"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.1">your appreciation to the interviewer for their time when the interview is over. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.2">I make sure that I do it as soon as possible, and send an email expressing my thanks and repeating my interest in the role. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.3">This can help distinguish you from other possible candidates and demonstrate how committed you are to the position. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.4">It shows that we as candidates are interested in the position and are prepared to make the effort to get in touch with the employer to follow up after an interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.5">This will impress the company and distinguish us from other applicants who may not have </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.1">followed up.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.1">This also gives us the chance to highlight our qualifications and enthusiasm for the position. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.2">We can reaffirm our qualifications and experience and remind the employer of the potential benefit we might bring to the business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.3">The next stages in the employment process can be </span><a id="_idIndexMarker091"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.1">made clearer as a result of following up. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.2">It enables us to show our continuous interest in the position and inquire about the timetable </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.1">for decision-making.</span></span></p>
