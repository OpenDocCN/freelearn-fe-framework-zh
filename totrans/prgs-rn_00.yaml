- en: The React Native framework offers a range of powerful features that makes it
    possible to efficiently build high-quality, easy-to-maintain frontend applications
    across multiple platforms, such as iOS, Android, Linux, macOS X, Windows, and
    the web, helping you save both time and money.

- en: In *Professional React Native*, you’ll find the ultimate coverage of essential
    concepts, best practices, advanced processes, and easy-to-use tips for everyday
    developer problems. With step-by-step explanations, practical examples, and expert
    guidance, you’ll understand how React Native works under the hood and then use
    this knowledge to develop highly performant apps. As you follow along, you’ll
    learn the difference between React and React Native, navigate the React Native
    ecosystem, and revisit the basics of JavaScript and TypeScript that are needed
    to create a React Native application. You’ll also work with animations and control
    your app with gestures. Finally, you’ll be able to structure larger apps and improve
    developer efficiency through automated processes, testing, and continuous integration.

    give you a deeper understanding of React Native. It contains core concepts, explained
    on an example app, as well as theoretical information about the architecture of
    React Native and how to connect different platforms to the React Native JavaScript
    bundle.'

    in React Native*, covers different areas, which are all important to create a
    high-quality product with React Native. You have to focus on good user experience,
    which includes a good design and clear navigation. Also, your users should be
    able to use as much of your app as possible without a network connection, which
    means working with locally stored data.'

    focuses on onscreen animations. There are multiple ways to achieve smooth animations
    in React Native. Depending on the type of project and animation you want to build,
    you can choose from a wide range of solutions, each with its own advantages and
    disadvantages. We will discuss the best and most widely used solutions in this
    chapter.'
