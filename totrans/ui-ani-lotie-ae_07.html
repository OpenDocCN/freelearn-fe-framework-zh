			<h1 id="_idParaDest-90"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Chapter 5</em>: Share It With the World: Working With LottieFiles</h1>
			<p>Here we are, ready to export our awesome first Lottie animation as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file to then add it to our app or website using <strong class="bold">React Native</strong>. Our app is minutes away from looking stunning and making a quality change. Follow me!</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to learn how to export our Lottie animation using both Bodymovin and LottieFiles plugins for Adobe <strong class="bold">After Effects</strong> (<strong class="bold">AE</strong>). We will guide you through creating a LottieFiles platform account so that we can preview our animations and hand them off to developers. We will also have a look at the LottieFiles mobile app for iOS so that we can effortlessly test our animations directly on mobile. We will also teach you how to create simple animations without even using AE and, finally, we will have some fun by converting animations into stickers for Telegram.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exporting our animations from AE to <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> files</li>
				<li>Creating an account in LottieFiles</li>
				<li>Exploring the LottieFiles dashboard</li>
				<li>Importance of testing in desktop and mobile Lottie platforms</li>
				<li>Creating and editing Lottie animations without using AE</li>
				<li>Converting <strong class="bold">Scalable Vector Graphics</strong> (<strong class="bold">SVG</strong>) files to animated Lottie files</li>
				<li>Converting Lottie files to GIFs</li>
				<li>Creating Telegram stickers and sticker sets</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>For this chapter, we are going to need some specific plugins that will help us export our animation as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file and preview them on both desktop and mobile devices. The tools that we require are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adobe AE</li>
				<li>Bodymovin for AE plugin</li>
				<li>LottieFiles for AE plugin</li>
				<li>LottieFiles for mobile</li>
				<li>Chrome, Safari, or a browser of your choice</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>Exporting our animation for handoff</h1>
			<p>To export <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>our animation from AE to a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file, we can use <strong class="bold">Bodymovin</strong> and <strong class="bold">LottieFiles</strong> plugins for AE. But, do we have to learn both? You are free to use any of them; they are available to download, are free to use, and are fully maintained and supported. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Downloading and Installing the Plugins</p>
			<p class="callout">For downloading and a <em class="italic">how-to</em> installation guide, you can jump ahead to <a href="B17930_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Don't Stop! Exploring Plugins and Resources That Will Keep You Going</em>, where we will guide you through the process.</p>
			<p>So, just choose the one you feel more comfortable with or the one that best matches your workflow. Maybe working with Bodymovin is all you need, however, LottieFiles will give you additional testing and preview tools.</p>
			<p>For me, I'm really used to working with Bodymovin, especially because, as you know by now, this was the first plugin ever to exist that would convert your animation into a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file; it is simple and does the job. But, times change and new tools with new features appear. </p>
			<p>There is a big team of professionals working behind the scenes of LottieFiles. I must say, these days, the LottieFiles plugin matches my workflow better. It allows me to easily preview my <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>animations on both desktop and mobile devices and share them with stakeholders in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>That said, I suggest you go through both plugins and then decide which one suits you best. Let's start by exploring Bodymovin.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>Exporting our animation using Bodymovin</h2>
			<p>As we've seen in earlier chapters, Bodymovin was the first plugin ever released for AE that would <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>allow us to export <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>our animation as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file, and it works perfectly well. It is simple and gives some interesting exporting options, which we will see in a minute.</p>
			<p>But, before we start, we are assuming you have already installed Bodymovin for AE, otherwise, you can jump ahead to <a href="B17930_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Don't Stop! Exploring Plugins and Resources That Will Keep You Going</em>, and follow the steps to install it.</p>
			<p>Right, let's say we've got everything ready to go (Adobe AE and the Bodymovin plugin installed), so let's open the Bodymovin plugin in AE:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open Adobe After Effects.</li>
				<li>Open our <strong class="source-inline">check_icon.ae</strong> project.</li>
				<li>Go to the top navigation menu and click on <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Extensions</strong> | <strong class="bold">Bodymovin</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer157" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_01.jpg" alt="Figure 5.1 – Opening the Bodymovin panel in AE&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1 – Opening the Bodymovin panel in AE</p>
			<p>Let's check the <strong class="bold">Bodymovin</strong> panel.</p>
			<p>First, the <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>panel opens up in the <strong class="bold">Render</strong> view. This is the view we are going to be focusing <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>on as the other options are not relevant for us at this point. As we can see in <em class="italic">Figure 5.2</em>, the two compositions contained in our project are listed here as <strong class="bold">check_icon</strong> and <strong class="bold">Sparks</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer158" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_02.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 – Bodymovin composition view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2 – Bodymovin composition view</p>
			<p>We can export any of the compositions listed in the panel, but we want to export the whole animation. So, which of the compositions listed in the panel should we export? That's right, the main composition that contains the whole animation, which is the <strong class="bold">check_icon</strong> composition.</p>
			<p>For each composition, there are a few settings we could adjust before exporting. That comes in <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>handy in cases <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>where we are using images, expressions, and live text, but as you know, I strongly recommend keeping our animations as simple as possible. If you want to get further information on that, you can check our discussion of supported Lottie features in <a href="B17930_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Don't Stop! Exploring Plugins and Resources That Will Keep You Going.</em></p>
			<p>Now, let's export our animation:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the little circle to the left of the <strong class="bold">check_icon</strong> composition, below the <strong class="bold">Selected</strong> column.</li>
				<li>Click on the three green dots icon to the right to save your .<strong class="source-inline">json</strong> file and choose your folder destination. Notice the <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file is named as <strong class="source-inline">data.json</strong> by default, but you can give it any name you want. I'm going to call mine <strong class="source-inline">check_icon.json</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer159" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_03.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 – check_icon selected&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3 – check_icon selected</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>now see <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>the <strong class="bold">Render</strong> button is highlighted and the destination folder is visible next to the <strong class="bold">check_icon</strong> name. Let's click the <strong class="bold">Render</strong> button:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer160" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_04.jpg" alt="Figure 5.4 – Render button highlighted&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4 – Render button highlighted</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Click the <strong class="bold">Done</strong> button:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer161" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_05.jpg" alt="Figure 5.5 – Render successfully done&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.5 – Render successfully done</p>
			<p>Great! Our <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>animation is exported <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file and is ready for preview. But, before we do that, we are going to show you how to do the same using the LottieFiles plugin.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>Exporting our animation using LottieFiles</h2>
			<p>People <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>in the LottieFiles <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>community have been very busy these last years and have come up with a new plugin for AE <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>called <strong class="bold">LottieFiles</strong>.</p>
			<p>The LottieFiles plugin is based on the actual Bodymovin open source but has some extra features that Bodymovin doesn't. That's why we are going to see how to export your animation using LottieFiles as well.</p>
			<p>So, we <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>are assuming you've <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>got everything ready to go, otherwise, move ahead to the <em class="italic">Installing LottieFiles plugin</em> section in <a href="B17930_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Don't Stop! Exploring Plugins and Resources That Will Keep You Going</em>, where we will show you the details on how to download and install the LottieFiles plugin.</p>
			<p>Whenever you are ready, let's open the LottieFiles plugin in AE:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open Adobe After Effects, in case you haven't done it yet.</li>
				<li>Open our <strong class="source-inline">check_icon.ae</strong> project.</li>
				<li>Go to the top navigation menu and click on <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Extensions</strong> | <strong class="bold">LottieFiles</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer162" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.6 – Opening the LottieFiles panel in AE</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Keep in Mind</p>
			<p class="callout">To be <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>able to access the <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>LottieFiles plugin panel, you will need to create a LottieFiles platform account. We are covering that in the following section, so if you want to create your account now, just jump to the next section and then come back again. We will wait for you here.</p>
			<p>Great! So, now that everything is sorted, let's check the LottieFiles plugin for AE panel. </p>
			<p>At first sight, the LottieFiles panel is quite similar to Bodymovin. Both open up on the composition panel. We can also see a list of our compositions, the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> tool icon next <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>to each composition, and <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>the <strong class="bold">Exporting</strong> arrow icon to export our animation, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.7</em> for reference:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer163" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.7 – LottieFiles panel composition view</p>
			<p>Next to the <strong class="bold">Composition</strong> panel, we find some other icons such as an <em class="italic">eye</em> and a <em class="italic">compass</em>:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<div>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.8 – LottieFiles panel top-bar icons</p>
			<p>The <em class="italic">eye</em> represents the <strong class="bold">Preview</strong> panel. In this panel, we can find every previously rendered animation we've done so far, as shown in the following figure:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.9 – LottieFiles panel Previews view</p>
			<p>By <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>selecting any of the <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>shown animations, we will see its details such as the file size, frame rate, dimensions, and time of export. We can also change the background color to see how it looks in different scenarios or export it directly to our LottieFiles mobile app. We can save the file or share it with the community by clicking on the little <em class="italic">world</em> icon:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.10 – LottieFiles panel preview details</p>
			<p>The <em class="italic">compass</em> stands for the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> panel. In this panel, we can look into the LottieFiles <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>library for free <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>animations to use or get inspired. This becomes very handy when we don't need a totally personalized animation. Imagine we need a loading bar; we can search for one, load it into AE, and change whatever we need to, such as the color, the time, and so on.</p>

			<p>I sometimes <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>look for an <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>animation to use as a starting point of what I have in mind, to check how it was done, or just for style or timing inspiration.</p>
			<p>Some of the animations in the LottieFiles library contain the <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file as well as the AE file, free to download and use. To know whether the animation can be downloaded as an AE file, you need to look for the ones that contain the <strong class="bold">Download AEP File</strong> button:</p>

			<p>Now <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>that we've been through <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>the different LottieFiles panel options, such as the <strong class="bold">Composition</strong>, <strong class="bold">Preview</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Search</strong> panels, let's focus on exporting our animation.</p>
			<p>To do that, execute the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Let's click back on the <strong class="bold">Compositions</strong> panel view.</li>
				<li>Click on the arrow next to <strong class="bold">check_icon</strong>:</li>

			<p>Our <strong class="bold">check_icon</strong> animation <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>shows up in the panel.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Now, we <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>can save our file as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">.lottie</strong> file, which, as we mentioned earlier, is the same, or upload it to our previews:</li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.15 – LottieFiles panel – our new icon uploaded to the Previews view</p>
			<p>Fantastic! We <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>just exported <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>our animation as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file, which means we have created our first ever Lottie!</p>
			<p>Now that we know how to export our AE animated file to <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> files either by using Bodymovin or LottieFiles plugins, let's move to get into the LottieFiles platform, and to do that, we are going to create a user. Let's go!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Creating a user account in LottieFiles</h1>
			<p>We've <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>got our animation exported as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file and <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>with that in hand, we could pass it over to the technical team or move ahead to the third part of this book, <em class="italic">Adding Your Lottie Animations Into Mobile Apps</em>, and learn how to implement our animation in our app.</p>
			<p>But, let's not rush; the LottieFiles platform allows us to upload and test our animation before handing it off to the development team in no time, and that way, we ensure that everything is in place and we haven't used any feature that is not supported.</p>
			<p>To do <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>that, and as we've mentioned earlier, we need <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>to sign up at the LottieFiles platform in order to be able to export our animations using the LottieFiles plugin for AE:</p>

			<p>And, you are done! </p>
			<p>As we <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>mentioned in <a href="B17930_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Get Started With Lottie</em>, there <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>are plenty of things you can do on the LottieFiles desktop platform including searching for animations, hiring animators, buying or selling animations, and searching for plugins and tools. But, for now, we are going to be focusing on our user dashboard, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.18</em>:</p>

			<p>Before <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>we move to the next section to start exploring <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>the LottieFiles platform, let me do a bit of a recap here. In this chapter, you just created your first LottieFiles account and exported the animation as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file using both Bodymovin and LottieFiles plugins for AE. There is just one step left for uploading and previewing our animated icon and sharing it with the world!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Exploring the LottieFiles dashboard</h1>
			<p>The LottieFiles <a id="_idIndexMarker306"/>platform allows us to upload, keep, and share our animations with developers, clients, and even with the world if we want to. And, not only that, but it also gives us the statistics about our public animations as well as information about likes, purchases, and more. How? Let's check it out. To do so, just hover over your avatar and select any of the options, such as, for example, the <strong class="bold">My Public Animations</strong> option:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer175" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.19 – The My Dashboard menu view</p>
			<p>Once we <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>open up our dashboard, we can see a few different options listed on the left-hand side of the screen. There is also an empty central section in which we see a message encouraging us to upload our first animation:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.20 – The My Dashboard menu view</p>
			<p>As you will see, LottieFiles is a very intuitive and easy tool to use. But, let's have a quick overview <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>of the menu on the left. Here, we see a few sections, which we will look at next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>My Downloads</h2>
			<p>The My <a id="_idIndexMarker309"/>Downloads section is the place where we find a list by date of any animation that we have downloaded from the LottieFiles platform. Any <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">.ae</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">.gif</strong>, or any other file format you have downloaded will appear here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer177" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.21 – My Downloads view</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>My Likes</h2>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>section, we find a list of all the animations we have given likes to. I use it as a <em class="italic">save for later</em> kind of feature, so anytime I'm searching through LottieFiles and I see some animation that can work for me as a reference in the future, I give it a like so it gets saved in this section:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.22 – My Likes view</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>My Public Animations</h2>
			<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>are up to sharing your animations with the public, this section is quite cool. Here, you'll find some statistics about likes other users have given you, the times your animations have been downloaded, and profile views. You'll also see a preview of all your published-to-the-public animations as well as the ones that are in review for sharing:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.23 – My Public Animations view</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>My Purchases</h2>
			<p>Any time <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>you purchase an animation, it will come up here. In my case, this area is empty, as I normally create my own animations, but I encourage you to have a quick look at the marketplace. It can provide inspiration as there are so many good animators out there:</p>

			<p>And finally, and <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>for me, the one I use the most, is the <strong class="bold">My Private Animations</strong> section. Here is where you'll find all the animations you have previewed in the LottieFiles AE plugin or the ones you have uploaded through the LottieFiles desktop and mobile platforms:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer181" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.25 – My Private Animations view</p>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>we are familiar with our LottieFiles dashboard, let's start uploading our animation; just follow me to the next section where we will learn all about it.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>The importance of testing in desktop and mobile LottieFiles platforms</h1>
			<p>And, here <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>we are, about to upload our animations <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>to LottieFiles and get them ready to hand off. This is a very exciting moment for me. I see three big milestones when animating for Lottie. First, when we render our animation in AE using Bodymovin or LottieFiles plugins and we check everything works; the second big moment is this, right here, right now, when we are about to upload it into the platform to check everything works fine, and the third one is when our animation is live! But, let's not hurry; let's upload our icon and check everything is working nicely.</p>
			<p>There are three ways to preview our .<strong class="source-inline">json</strong> animations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In the preview window of the LottieFiles plugin for AE.</li>
				<li>Upload, preview, and handoff in the LottieFiles browser platform.</li>
				<li>Preview in the LottieFiles apps for Android and iOS.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Previewing .json files using the LottieFiles plugin for AE</h2>
			<p>As we've <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>already seen earlier in this <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>chapter, once we render our animation in the LottieFiles plugin for AE, we can automatically see a preview of it in the same plugin panel, in the <strong class="bold">Views</strong> section. That's not the only thing we can do here. We can also do the following: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>View more information about the file size.</li>
				<li>Change the background color for the preview.</li>
				<li>Save it as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">.lottie</strong> file.</li>
				<li>Upload the file to <strong class="bold">My Private Animations</strong> in the LottieFiles dashboard.</li>
				<li>Generate a QR code to scan it from our mobile devices to preview it there.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So, as you can see, the LottieFiles plugin allows us to render, preview, upload, and hand off our animation all from the same place.</p>
			<p>That said, I highly recommend uploading and previewing <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> files wherever they are going to be shown (web, iOS, and/or Android), even if my animation looks perfect in the LottieFiles plugin. You'll experience why I say that soon.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Uploading and previewing .json files on the LottieFiles platform</h2>
			<p>Let's see <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>how to get to the next step; let's <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>see how to upload and preview <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>our <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> animation. We have <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>already rendered and saved our <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> animation with Bodymovin or LottieFiles plugins and now I want to test my animation and double-check everything works as expected. How? On <strong class="bold">My Dashboard</strong>.</p>
			<p>Let's upload our animation. It is as easy as clicking on the <strong class="bold">Upload Animation</strong> button, which we can find in our LottieFiles browser dashboard, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.26</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer182" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.26 – Upload Animation button on the My Dashboards view</p>
			<p>Once <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>we click on the button to upload <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>the file, a new window comes <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>up. As you can see in the following <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>screenshot, uploading our <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file is as easy as dragging it to the window:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.27 – Upload Animation drag and drop/browse screen</p>
			<p>So, let's do that, let's drag our <strong class="source-inline">icon_check.json</strong> file here.</p>
			<p>Once we do that, we will find a <strong class="bold">Preview</strong> window with our animation and also a few options that can be adjusted, such as background color and speed, for example:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer184" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.28 – Preview window</p>
			<p>As <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>you can see, previewing and testing <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> files <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>in the LottieFiles dashboard <a id="_idIndexMarker329"/>is very easy and straightforward. Let's <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>move to the next section to learn to do the same from a mobile device.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>Previewing our Lottie animations in the mobile LottieFiles app</h2>
			<p>Previewing <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>our animations <a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>is a smart thing to do and will avoid us handing off LottieFiles that don't work properly. Remember we mentioned earlier, back in <a href="B17930_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor074"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a><em class="italic">, Move It! Animating Our First Lottie With After Effects</em>, there are some features not supported for specific devices. For example, <strong class="bold">radial burst</strong> is not supported on iOS. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Supported Features</p>
			<p class="callout">You can learn more about supported features of LottieFiles in <a href="B17930_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Don't Stop! Exploring Plugins and Resources That Will Keep You Going</em>, in the <em class="italic">Supported Lottie features for iOS, Android, and the web</em> section.</p>
			<p>Let's see what happens when we preview the animation in our iOS mobile app:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go back to AE.</li>
				<li>Open <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>the <strong class="bold">LottieFiles</strong> panel <a id="_idIndexMarker334"/>and scroll down to the bottom, where you'll see a list of your available devices:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer185" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_29.jpg" alt="Figure 5.29 – Show QR Code button on the LottieFiles plugin for AE preview panel&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.29 – Show QR Code button on the LottieFiles plugin for AE preview panel</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Select the one you want to test. In my case, I'm going to choose <strong class="bold">iPhone12Mini</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Show QR Code</strong> button:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer186" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_30.jpg" alt="Figure 5.30 – Generated QR code on the LottieFiles plugin for AE preview panel&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.30 – Generated QR code on the LottieFiles plugin for AE preview panel</p>
			<p>Now, let's <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>grab your <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>phone to finish the process:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Open up the LottieFiles app.</li>
				<li>Click on <strong class="bold">Scan</strong> to scan the QR code and voilà, the animation shows up here!</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you are doing this from an iOS device, you'll notice something weird is happening, right? <strong class="bold">Radial burst</strong> is not showing correctly! Why? We've rendered our animations in AE using Bodymovin and LottieFiles plugins and it seemed to preview well. Also, when we uploaded it onto the LottieFiles dashboard, the animation showed properly, but not now, at least not on an iOS device (if you are checking this from an Android, you won't know what I'm talking about as it works perfectly well on Android, Windows, and the web).</p>
			<p>But, why is that? Did we do something wrong? Well, not really, it's just because this feature is not supported on iOS. There, I've said it. Radial burst won't work on any iOS device. So, why have we done it in the first place? Of course, there is a list of supported features <a id="_idIndexMarker337"/>by device and platform, however, I wanted you to experience on your own how important it is to test things <a id="_idIndexMarker338"/>before handing them off. No matter how sure we are that something is going to work, sometimes, things just don't.</p>
			<p>LottieFiles plugins and platforms are iterating constantly; one day things work, the next day, they don't, or vice versa. So, my suggestion here is to always <em class="italic">test</em>.</p>
			<p>So, now what? Well, we can use our great animation with its radial burst effect for the web, Windows, and Android. But, what if we want to use it on iOS; do we have to go back to AE and redo things? Not really, LottieFiles allows us to tweak a few things in our animations without the need to go back to AE. So, stay with me, we are going to correct that in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Creating and editing a Lottie without using AE</h1>
			<p>That last <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>section was a bit of a low kick; we were <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>all really happy with our cool animation and now what? The nice effect won't show on iOS. Well, these things happen sometimes. We now have three choices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Complain about it.</li>
				<li>Go back to AE and add some little circles around our animation, one by one.</li>
				<li>Be lean and just remove the <strong class="bold">radial burst</strong> effect.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I'll go with the third option and you'll see how quick that is. We don't even need to go back to AE. Let's open <strong class="bold">Lottie Editor</strong>. To do that, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go to the LottieFiles web dashboard.</li>
				<li>Go to the left menu and select <strong class="bold">My Private Animations</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/>on the <strong class="bold">check_icon</strong> animation.</li>
				<li>Click <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>on the <strong class="bold">Edit Animation</strong> button, as highlighted in <em class="italic">Figure 5.31</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer187" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_31.jpg" alt="Figure 5.31 – Edit Animation button in LottieFiles desktop dashboard preview window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.31 – Edit Animation button in LottieFiles desktop dashboard preview window</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Lottie Editor</strong> appears and here is where we can also perform some magic. As we said, I'm going to keep my super cool sparkling icon for the web and Android and I'm going to adjust it for iOS.</p>
			<p>Let's check the editor workspace view:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer188" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_32.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.32 – Editor workspace view</p>
			<p>On <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>the left-hand <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>side panel, we see <strong class="bold">LOTTIE URL</strong>, <strong class="bold">LOTTIE PROPERTIES,</strong> and <strong class="bold">LAYERS</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer189" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_33.jpg" alt="Figure 5.33 – Left-hand side editor panel&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.33 – Left-hand side editor panel</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Lottie URL</h2>
			<p>The Lottie URL is <a id="_idIndexMarker345"/>the actual <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> code itself. It contains all your animation's information and can be used to share your animation with the technical team. However, there are also some other more visual ways to share your animations, as we will soon see.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>Lottie properties</h2>
			<p>When <strong class="bold">LOTTIE PROPERTIES</strong> is selected, a new panel opens up on the right-hand side of <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.34</em>. In this panel, we can change a few of our animation properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">ANIMATION PREFERENCES</strong>: This is the place where we can adjust <strong class="bold">DIMENSIONS</strong>, <strong class="bold">FRAME RATE</strong>, and <strong class="bold">DURATION</strong> of the animation.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">PLAYBACK SETTINGS</strong>: Lottie also allows us to change <strong class="bold">BACKGROUND COLOR</strong> but just for preview. So, since our animation is a white-over-white background, let's pick a different color. And, we can also adjust <strong class="bold">PLAYBACK SPEED</strong> to <strong class="bold">1.5x</strong>, <strong class="bold">2x</strong>, or <strong class="bold">2.5x</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">GROUPED COLORS</strong>: Here is where the magic happens. The colors we can see listed are the ones contained in the animation. We can change them by just clicking on one of them and selecting a new one. This will change the color everywhere in our animation but, if you stay with me for a moment, I'll show you how to change it bit by bit.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">TELEGRAM STICKER EXPORT</strong>: Here is where you can effortlessly convert your animation for Telegram, but we will see that in a minute. Let's focus on the editor for now.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">EXPORT AS LOTTIE JSON</strong>: Once you are happy with your animation, you can export it just by clicking the blue button. Easy-peasy, right?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">UPLOAD TO LOTTIEFILES</strong>: We've seen that you can export your new animation as a Telegram sticker and as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file, but you could also upload it back as a new animation into your dashboard <strong class="bold">Previews</strong> section:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer190" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_34.jpg" alt="Figure 5.34 – Right-hand side editor panel&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.34 – Right-hand side editor panel</p>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>we know how to change the main properties of our Lottie animation directly into <strong class="bold">Lottie Editor</strong>, let's see what else can be done.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Layers</h2>
			<p>We've just seen <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>how to adjust some of the main properties of our animation, but <strong class="bold">Lottie Editor</strong> allows us to go a bit deeper into it thanks to layers.</p>
			<p>As we can see on the left-hand side of the screen (<em class="italic">Figure 5.35</em>), there are three different layers contained in our animation, which are the same as we've got in our AE animation: <strong class="bold">check</strong>, <strong class="bold">Oval</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Sparks</strong>.</p>
			<p>Now, let's <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>select <strong class="bold">Layers</strong> | <strong class="bold">check</strong> and see what we can do with it:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer191" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_35.jpg" alt="Figure 5.35 – Left-hand side panel, selected layer&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.35 – Left-hand side panel, selected layer</p>
			<p>When selecting the <strong class="bold">check</strong> layer, we notice on the right-hand side of the screen that the options change and new properties appear, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">LAYER VISIBILITY</strong>: This property will allow us to hide the selected layer when clicking the little eye icon on the right. If a layer is hidden, it won't be exported in the <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">COLORS</strong>: In here, we will find the colors used in each of the layers. In our case, we only see the blue color but if this layer had more colors, we would see them here and <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>could change them by just clicking on the color and selecting a new one.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">EXPORT LAYER</strong>: With this option, we can just export the selected layer as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file without including anything else:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer192" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_36.jpg" alt="Figure 5.36 – Layer properties view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.36 – Layer properties view</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">PROPERTIES FOR TEXT LAYER</strong>: There is an extra option that we won't see in our icon example, which is <strong class="bold">PROPERTIES FOR TEXT LAYER</strong>. Although, if we had some text in our animation, we would see the text layer on the left-hand side of the screen, and when selecting it, we would see a different panel on <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>the right-hand side of our working area, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.37</em>. The property we can change here is the content itself, but apart from that, there is not much more we can do to it, at least not yet. Also, I wouldn't rely on it too much as sometimes updated content won't show up properly or even show up at all.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer193" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_37.jpg" alt="Figure 5.37 – Text properties view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.37 – Text properties view</p>
			<p>So, having all that in mind, and depending on the project you are working on, it may come in handy to keep your layers as simple as possible in your AE project. Having a layer for each graphic may not be a bad idea as later on you can just come to <strong class="bold">Lottie Editor</strong> and adjust colors, show or hide them, or even change the content. Of course, that will depend on the project and the complexity of the animation, but it is always good to think in advance.</p>
			<p>That said, let's go back to our icon. What do you think we need to do in order to have the icon working properly on iOS? Easy! Just hide the <strong class="bold">Sparks</strong> layer and export it again as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file under another name. Let's do it:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the <strong class="bold">Sparks</strong> layer on the left-hand side of the screen.</li>
				<li>Click on the little eye icon that will appear on the right-hand side of the working area:</li>
			</ol>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.38 – Lottie Editor view – Sparks layer and hide icon highlighted</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Move to <strong class="bold">LOTTIE PROPERTIES</strong> and select <strong class="bold">check_icon</strong>.</li>
				<li>Export it <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>again as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file.</li>
				<li>Save it under a new name, for example, <strong class="source-inline">check_icon_ios.json</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer195" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.39 – Lottie Editor view with animation and Export as Lottie JSON button highlighted</p>
			<p>And that's it! We have our specific icon ready to be implemented. One for Android and web, and the other for iOS. We are ready to hand it off to the developer's team and we can be sure our animation will look exactly as we designed it and animated it with no surprises. </p>
			<p>Great! Now you know <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>how to adjust the color, speed, and dimensions of a Lottie animation or its layers and are ready to move forward. But, don't go yet. There is still some stuff that can be done with LottieFiles that I'd like to show you. Let's move to the next section and learn how to build animations from a simple SVG without even using AE at all.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Converting SVGs to animated Lotties in seconds</h1>
			<p>Now that we've learned what we can achieve with Lottie Editor, such as changing colors, hiding or <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>showing layers, exporting a single layer, and changing <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>the content, dimensions, or speed of the animation, let's move to learn some other features the LottieFiles platform allows us to do with our animation in a single step. Let's forget about our <strong class="bold">check_icon</strong>, which is ready to be handed off to the development team. Let's see how easy and simple it is to animate an SVG file.</p>
			<p>We talked about this feature back in <a href="B17930_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Get Started With Lottie</em> but now we are going to show you how to convert your SVG files to Lottie:</p>

				<li>Open the <strong class="source-inline">SVGtoLottie.svg</strong> file.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Well done! You'll notice the screen has changed, right? Let's see what's this all about.</p>
			<p>In the center <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>of the screen, we can see our static SVG, the <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>star. This is the SVG file we've just uploaded. To the left of the star, there is a window named <strong class="bold">Animations</strong>, which contains a bunch of already made animations, and to the right, we find the exporting options.</p>
			<p>So, this is it. Let's do an example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Choose an animation you like from the animation window.</li>
				<li>Check the results on the central view.</li>
				<li>Do you like it? No? Try something else. Yes? Let's export it to <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Download Lottie</strong> button, and there you have it!</li>

			<p>As simple <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>as that, you've just learned another <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>way to create your own animations. Obviously, this is a very simple animation, but it can do the job sometimes.</p>
			<p>So, now that you know how to animate an SVG, let's move on to converting Lottie to GIF.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Converting Lottie to GIF in just one click</h1>
			<p>If we are <a id="_idIndexMarker360"/>learning how to work with Lottie, it is because we want <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>to avoid adding animated GIF files to our apps and websites as much as possible. As we said earlier in this book, GIF files can be very heavy file-size-wise, have low-quality images, and won't be responsive. However, sometimes, we may need this kind of format, for example, to use it for some social media posts. </p>
			<p>LottieFiles gives us the option to convert the <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> file to GIF in the blink of an eye, and here is how:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go to <a href="https://lottiefiles.com/lottie-to-gif">https://lottiefiles.com/lottie-to-gif</a>.</li>
				<li>Browse for the <strong class="source-inline">lottie/chapter05/LottietoGIF.json</strong> file provided with this book (this is the Lottie we created in the <em class="italic">Converting SVGs to animated Lotties in seconds</em> section).</li>

			<p>Great! As <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>you can see, it is pretty straightforward. We see our animated star in the center of the screen, and a couple of options such as <strong class="bold">Background color</strong> and <strong class="bold">Resolution</strong> on the right-hand side. So, this is it. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Choose a background color for your star; I'll just go with white.</li>
				<li>Select a resolution; I think <strong class="bold">500 x 500</strong> works for me.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Convert to GIF</strong> button:</li>
			</ol>

			<p>You'll notice <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>the animation may take some time to be <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>converted, especially if we are working with complex ones. Just be patient. Also, notice as well that once the conversion is done, the <strong class="bold">Convert to GIF</strong> button is replaced by the <strong class="bold">Download GIF</strong> button:</p>

			</ol>
			<p>You have your <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> animation converted into a GIF file ready to use anywhere. </p>
			<p>So, now that you've learned how to convert your Lottie animation into a GIF file using LottieFiles features, let's move to the next section and see how to create Telegram stickers with LottieFiles Editor.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>Creating your own personal stickers for Telegram</h1>
			<p>So, going <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>back to Lottie Editor, remember we <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>mentioned earlier that we can export our Lottie to be used as a Telegram sticker. Let's see how we do that. Don't be scared, it may look like a long process, but it is very straightforward:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go to <a href="https://lottiefiles.com/editor">https://lottiefiles.com/editor</a>.</li>
				<li>Browse for the <strong class="source-inline">lottie/chapter05/telegram_sticker.json</strong> file provided with this book, which is a simple waving hand animation I did some time <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>ago that I'm sharing here with you.</li>
				<li>Open <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>the <strong class="source-inline">telegram_sticker.json</strong> file.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer201" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_45.jpg" alt="Figure 5.45 – Drag and drop or browse the Lottie Editor screen&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.45 – Drag and drop or browse the Lottie Editor screen</p>
			<p>Cool! Once the file is uploaded, you'll notice the view has changed and we are back to Lottie Editor, which we were working with earlier in this chapter. Notice the waving hand has loaded in the center of the screen, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer202" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B17930_05_46.jpg" alt="Figure 5.46 – Waving hand animation running in Lottie Editor&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.46 – Waving hand animation running in Lottie Editor</p>
			<p>Now, let's continue to create the Telegram sticker.</p>
			<p>There <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>are two specs we have to review <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>before exporting our animation as a Telegram sticker. These are <strong class="bold">DIMENSIONS</strong> and <strong class="bold">DURATION</strong>. <strong class="bold">DIMENSIONS</strong> has to be <strong class="bold">512</strong> by <strong class="bold">512</strong> exactly and <strong class="bold">DURATION</strong> cannot be longer than <strong class="bold">3.00</strong> seconds. However, remember we can always tweak this directly in <strong class="bold">Lottie Editor</strong>.</p>
			<p>Since I'm reusing an old animation here, and by the time I made it, I wasn't thinking to use it for Telegram, we have to adjust the dimensions to <strong class="source-inline">512</strong>. So, let's change that in <strong class="bold">Lottie Editor</strong>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Set <strong class="bold">H</strong> and <strong class="bold">W</strong> both to <strong class="source-inline">512</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Update</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The duration is okay, as it is just 3 seconds. The <strong class="bold">ANIMATION PREFERENCES</strong> panel is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer203" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.47 – Waving hand preferences</p>
			<p>Perfect, now <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>that we've got everything <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>sorted, let's move a little bit down on the same panel. We are looking for the <strong class="bold">TELEGRAM STICKER EXPORT</strong> tool. You should see it by scrolling down on the right-hand side panel.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">Click on the little blue button to download the waving hand as a Telegram sticker.</li>

			<p>Isn't that cool? Now you know how to create an animation, import it to Lottie Editor, download it as a Telegram sticker, and create your own set of stickers in Telegram for you to share. Congratulations! We've gone a long way!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Wow! That's a lot of stuff we have done here; great job! And you know the best part? You are ready to have some fun and start creating your own animations from scratch to hand off! So far, we've learned how to export our animations from AE as <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> files using the Bodymovin and LottieFiles plugins. We've gone through the process to test the exported <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> files in AE, desktop, and mobile and realized the importance of testing it on every device before handing it off to the development team.</p>
			<p>We've also created an account in the LottieFiles platform and learned all about the LottieFiles dashboard, where you can keep all your animations together. We've discovered Lottie Editor and how to quickly tweak any <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> animation by changing the colors, dimensions, speed, and content.</p>
			<p>We've also learned how to create very simple but straightforward animations by using static SVG files and also how to convert Lotties to GIFs for our social media or other related content.</p>
			<p>And finally, the most fun part of it, we've exported a Lottie animation as a Telegram sticker and learned how to create a Telegram sticker set using the Stickers bot.</p>
			<p>So, are you ready to fly the nest? I bet you are and that you've already started thinking about all the big things you can achieve and how cool, consistent, and user-friendly your apps will look from now on.</p>
			<p>But, before I leave you to it, I'd like to share some references, tips, and tricks that may help you with the process. So, follow me to the next chapter, where I will tell you all about them.</p>
