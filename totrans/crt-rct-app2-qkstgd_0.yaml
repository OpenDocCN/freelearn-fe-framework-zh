- en: Create React App is, in my mind, the ultimate example of a proper bootstrapping
    tool. Instead of the multiple hours of tedium getting everything tweaked and configured
    to be just right and hoping that you haven't missed anything along the way, you
    are instead given a tool and a project that is built and ready to go from the
    first minute you want to start embarking on your project. Now, the start up time
    to get moving on a project that is fully-featured goes from hours, or maybe even
    days, to minutes, and nothing is stopping you from building the React project
    of your dreams!

    Create React App tool. We'll cover all of the commands, all of the new additions
    in version 2, and we'll cover actually building a project from scratch and touching
    on all of the key concepts along the way to make sure you're able to take advantage
    of this tool to the absolute fullest!
