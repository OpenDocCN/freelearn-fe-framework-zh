    typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript brings in features such as type safety
    and enhanced tooling support, which contribute to the robustness of Angular applications.
    This combination of TypeScript’s strong typing and Angular’s architecture makes
    the framework highly scalable, a feature that’s vital when it comes to building
    complex and large-scale applications.

    the screen on a website. Components are modular and reusable, which promotes a

    to manage and reason about your application as it grows in size and complexity.
