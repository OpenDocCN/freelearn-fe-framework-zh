    years, even before official support was included in the **React API**. The evolution
    of React has brought about APIs that are specifically designed to assist in code-splitting
    scenarios. Code splitting becomes crucial when dealing with large applications
    containing a vast amount of JavaScript code that needs to be delivered to a browser.'

    could cause usability issues due to long initial page load times. Thanks to code
    splitting, we now have much more granular control over how code is transferred
    from the server to the browser. This gives us ample opportunities to optimize
    load-time **User Experience** (**UX**).

    by using the `lazy()` API and the `Suspense` components. These features are very
    powerful tools in the React toolbox. By gaining a thorough understanding of how
    these components function, you’ll be fully equipped to seamlessly integrate code
    splitting into your applications.

    there’s bundling components into their own separate files so that they can be
    downloaded by the browser separately from other parts of the application. Second,
    once you have created the bundles, you can build React components that are lazy:
    they don’t download anything until they are needed. Let’s look at both of these.'

    The nice thing about this approach is that you don’t have to maintain any bundle
    configuration. Instead, bundles are created for you automatically, based on how
    you import your modules. If you’re using the plain `import` statement (not to
    be confused with the `import` method) everywhere, your app will be downloaded
    all at once in one bundle. When your app gets bigger, there will likely be features
    that some users never use or don’t use as frequently as others. You can use the
    `import()` function to import modules on demand. By using this function, you’re
    telling Vite to create a separate bundle for the code that you’re importing dynamically.

    you open the browser dev tools and look at the network requests, you’ll notice
    that a separate call is made to fetch the bundle containing the `MyComponent`
    code. This happens because of the call to `import("./MyComponent")`. The `import()`
    function returns a promise that resolves with the module object. Since we need
    the default export to access `MyComponent`, we reference `module.default` when
    we call `setMyComponent()`.
  prefs: []

    when the `App` component renders for the first time, we don’t have the `MyComponent`
    code loaded yet. Once it loads, `MyComponent` will reference the proper value,
    which results in the correct text being rendered.

    What’s important to note with the `MyPage` component is that it is rendering a
    lazy component (`MyFeature`) but isn’t rendering a `Suspense` component. This
    is because our hypothetical app has many page components, each with its own lazy
    components. Having each of these components render its own `Suspense` component

    when components are rendered for the first time. Next, we looked more deeply at
    the `Suspense` component, which is used to manage content while component bundles
    are being fetched. The `fallback` property is how we specify the content to be
    shown while bundles are being loaded. You typically don’t need more than one `Suspense`
