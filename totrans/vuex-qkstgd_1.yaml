    remember my friend Giuseppe saying, *You don't like JavaScript, do you?* and me
    answering, *No, I don't. Each time I write something in JavaScript, it doesn't
    work in all versions of Internet Explorer... not to mention Firefox!* He just
    replied, *Have a look at jQuery*. Today, I like to call myself a JavaScript programmer.

    became popular and then declined because new frameworks emerged. You may think
    that it is not worth learning new frameworks since they will eventually decline
    in popularity. Well, in my opinion, that is not true. Each framework added something
    useful to web development, something that we still use. For example, jQuery made
    use of JavaScript that was so simple that we started moving client logic to the
    browser instead of rendering everything server-side.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Actions define the internal API of your application. They represent what can
    be done, but not how it is done. The logic of state mutation is contained inside
    stores. An action is simply an object with a type and some data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Actions should be meaningful to the reader and they should avoid implementation
    details. For example, `remove-product-from-cart` is better than splitting it into
    `update-server-cart`, `refresh-cart-list`, and `update-money-total`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An action is dispatched to all the stores and it can cause more than one store
    to update. So dispatching an action will result in one or more stores executing
    the corresponding action handler.

- en: Mutations
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Actions represent a behavior of an application, something that the application
    must do. The result of an action consists typically of one or more mutations being
    committed. Committing a mutation means executing its associated handler. It is
    not possible to change the Vuex state directly inside an action; instead, actions
    commit mutations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have to deal with asynchronous code inside actions, since mutations must
    be synchronous.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mutations, on the other hand, can and do modify the application state. They
    represent the application logic directly connected to the application state. Mutations
    should be simple, since complex behavior should be handled by actions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since there is only one store in Vuex, actions are dispatched using the store,
    and there is a direct connection between an action and its handler. In Flux, on
    the other hand, every store knows what to do when responding to the action.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will read about the Vuex action/mutation system in the following chapters.
    Right now, you just need to understand the concepts behind actions, and that Vuex
    implements actions in a slightly different way than the one used by Flux.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dispatcher
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is only one dispatcher per application, and it receives actions and dispatches
    them to the stores. Every store receives every action. It is a simple mechanism
    to dispatch actions, and it can handle dependencies between stores by dispatching
    actions to the stores in a specific order.

    in Flux, each one representing a domain within the application. In Vuex, there
    is only one store, and its state is called a single state tree. Vuex is not the
    only framework that enforces the use of a single store: Redux explicitly states
    that there is one store per Redux application. You may think that a single store
    may break modularity. We will see later how modularity works on Vuex.'

    state where all the information is stored. Think of the state as an application
