- en: Animations can be used to improve the user experience in mobile applications.
    They usually help users to quickly recognize that something has changed, or help
    them focus on what is important. They improve the user experience and user satisfaction.
    Also, animations are simply fun to look at. For example, the heartbeat reaction
    in the Instagram app when you like a post or the Snapchat ghost animation when
    refreshing a page.

- en: In the React Native world, we have a lot of libraries and approaches to animate
    our components, including the built-in **Animated API**. But in this chapter,
    I would like to opt for a library called **React Native Reanimated** and compare
    it with the Animated API to learn why it is the best choice.

- en: The Animated API
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **Animated API** is the most common tool used to animate components in React
    Native. It has a set of methods that help you to create an animation object, control
    its state, and process it. The main benefit is that it can be used with any component,
    and not just animated components such as View or Text.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, at the same time, this API has been implemented in the old architecture
    of React Native. Asynchronous communications between JavaScript and UI Native
    threads are used with the Animated API, delaying updates by at least one frame
    and lasting approximately 16 ms. Sometimes, the delay may last even longer if
    the JavaScript thread is running React’s diff algorithm and comparing or processing
    network requests simultaneously. The problem of dropped or delayed frames can
    be solved with the React Native Reanimated library, which is based on the new
    architecture and processes all business logic from the JavaScript thread in the
    UI thread.

- en: '**React Native Reanimated** can be utilized to provide a more exhaustive abstraction
    of the Animated API to use with React Native. It provides an imperative API with
    multistage animations and custom transitions, while at the same time providing
    a declarative API that can be used to describe simple animations and transitions
    in a similar way to how CSS transitions work. It’s built on top of React Native
    Animated and reimplements it on the Native thread. This allows you to use the
    familiar JavaScript language while taking advantage of the most high performance
    and simple API.'

    functions that can be synchronously executed within the UI thread. This allows
    instant animations without having to wait for a new frame. Let’s take a look at

  prefs: []

- en: '`useSharedValue`: This hook returns a `SharedValue` instance, which is the
    main stateful data object that lives in the UI thread context and has a similar
    concept to `Animated.Value` in the core Animated API. A Reanimated animation is
    triggered when `SharedValue` is changed. The key benefit is that updates to shared
    values can be synchronized across the React Native and UI threads without triggering
    a re-render. This enables complex animations to run smoothly at 60 FPS without
    blocking the JS thread.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`useDerivedValue`: This hook creates a new shared value that automatically
    updates whenever the shared values used in its calculation change. It allows you
    to create shared values that depend on other shared values, while keeping them
    all reactive. `useDerivedValue` is used to create a **derived** state in a worklet
    that runs on the UI thread based on updates to the source shared values. This
    derived state can then drive animations or other side effects without triggering
    a re-render on the JS thread.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`useAnimatedStyle`: The hook allows you to create a style object with the ability
    to animate its properties based on shared values. It maps shared value updates
    to the corresponding view properties. `useAnimatedStyle` is the main way to connect
    shared values to views and enable smooth animations running on the UI thread.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`withTiming`, `withSpring`, `withDecay`: These are animation utility methods
    that update a shared value in a smooth, animated way using various curves and
    physics. They allow you to define animations declaratively by specifying the target
    value and animation configuration.'

    This means that when your component renders for the first time and when you unmount
    your component, it appears animated. React Native Reanimated is an API that lets
    you animate layouts and add animations such as `FadeIn`, `BounceIn`, and `ZoomIn`.

    feedback. This button will be built using the `Pressable` component that we learned
    about in *Chapter 23*, *Responding to User Gestures*. This component accepts the
    `onPressIn`, `onLongPress`, and `onPressOut` events. As a result of these events,
    we will be able to see how our touches will be reflected on the button.

    using the `useSharedValue` hook. It takes default values as an argument. Next,
    we created the style object with the `useAnimatedStyle` hook. The hook accepts
    the callback that should return a style object. The `useAnimatedStyle` hook is
    similar to the `useMemo` hook, but all calculations are performed in the UI thread
    and all `SharedValue` changes will invoke the hook to recalculate the style object.
    The background color of the button was created using `useDerivedValue` by interpolating
    between orange and red to provide a smooth transition.

    makes updating styles smoother. Like the first handler, other ones will also update
    the style of the button but in different ways. `onLongPress` turns the button
    red and makes it smaller. `onPressOut` resets all values to their default values.
