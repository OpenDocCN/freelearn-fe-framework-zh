<p class="mce-root">Web components have long been touted as the next great leap forward in web development. With the new version of the Angular framework, we're closer than ever. Over the past couple of years, there's been a lot of buzz around web components in the web development community. New component-style directives in Angular will change developers' workflows and their thinking about shared and reusable blocks of custom HTML in the shadow DOM. By building a whole application from scratch, this book is a practical way to learn, giving readers the chance to build components of their own. With <em>Mastering Angular Components</em>, learners will get ahead of the curve in a new wave of web development by focusing on an area that's the key to unlocking the powers of Angular development.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><em>Mastering Angular Components</em> teaches readers to think in a component-based way when developing user interfaces. This rich guide to the new component-centric way of doing things in Angular teaches readers how to invent, build, and manage shared and reusable components for their web projects. This book will change how developers think about how to accomplish things in Angular, and the reader will work on useful and fun example components throughout.</p>

<p><a href="72fc993e-43db-48eb-8797-c65ea9226b87.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Component-Based User Interfaces</em>, looks at a bit of the history of UI development and provides a brief introduction to component-based user interfaces in general. We will see how Angular 2 handles this concept.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><a href="11f96942-6e99-46c5-b152-1af3b2579d44.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Ready, Set, Go!</em>, gets the reader started on their journey toward building an Angular 2 component-based application. It covers the basic elements of structuring an application with components.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><a href="0ae44400-ec3a-4fb6-816b-b5e808196718.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Dealing with Data and State</em>, focuses on how to build a clean data and state architecture into our application. We'll learn about reactive programming using RxJS, the pure component, the container component, and many more concepts, and tools that can be used to combat application state mess.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><a href="1682edec-f2b3-4b02-afd8-ed7ef586b712.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Thinking in Projects</em>, focuses on the structure of the user interface and its basic components. Readers will compose an application by organizing an application layout into components, establishing the composition of components, and creating a reusable tab component to structure the application interface. Readers will also build a re-usable editor component and a commenting system.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><a href="237031a7-f616-4811-8486-08b5113d316f.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Component-Based Routing</em>, explains how components react to routing and enables readers to add simple routing to existing components in the task management application. Readers will also work on the login process and gain an understanding of how to protect components using the router.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><a href="2ba38f09-ef9f-4aee-952f-3ade56c99356.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Keeping Up with Activities</em>, covers the creation of components that will visualize activity streams on both the project and task levels.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><a href="70aeeb16-2a1e-4d20-b523-00df06a8398a.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Components for User Experience</em>, guides readers on creating many small reusable components that will have a great effect on the overall user experience of the task management application. Benefits include the in-place editing of text fields, infinite scrolling, popup notifications, and drag-and-drop support.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><a href="43791ecf-9bd7-4439-ba76-8f34098d350a.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Time Will Tell</em>, focuses on creating time-tracking components that help estimate time on a project and task level, but also for users to log the time they spend on tasks.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><a href="bd2de27c-ce68-4692-84ee-3a85f98e84c2.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Spaceship Dashboard</em>, focuses on creating components to visualize data in the task management application using the third-party library Chartist.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><a href="bd25161a-e672-4790-aea2-8f39d696d5c9.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Putting Things to the Test</em>, covers some basic approaches to testing Angular components. We will look at the options for mocking/overriding specific parts of a component for testing.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Conventions used</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>Let's change the view encapsulation of our main component to use the </span><kbd>ViewEncapsulation.None</kbd><span> mode.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>import {Component, ViewEncapsulation} from '@angular/core';<br/><br/>@Component({<br/>  selector: 'mac-root',<br/>  templateUrl: './app.component.html',<br/>  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None<br/>})<br/>export class AppComponent {<br/>  title = 'mac';<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>...<br/><strong>import {TaskService} from './tasks/task.service';</strong><br/>...<br/>@NgModule({<br/>...<br/> <strong>providers: [TaskService],</strong><br/> ...<br/>})<br/>export class AppModule {<br/>}</pre>
<p>Sometimes, on large code excerpts that require you to implement code changes in existing code files, we use the following format:</p>
<ul>
<li>New or replaced code parts are marked in bold</li>
<li>Already existing and irrelevant code parts are hidden using an ellipsis character</li>
</ul>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>ng new mastering-angular-components --prefix=mac</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "You should be able to see the generated application app with a welcome message saying <span class="packt_screen">Welcome to mac!</span></span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
