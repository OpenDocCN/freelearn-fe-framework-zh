    where do we want to deploy the application itself?

    a slightly different deployment method. There are specific cloud platforms, such
    as Vercel, Netlify, and Heroku, where the deployment process is standardized and
    incredibly simplified to be accessible for everyone. With other cloud providers,
    such as AWS, Azure, and DigitalOcean, you have complete control over the whole
    deployment process. Unfortunately, in many cases, you have to implement this process
    on your own or use third-party software.

    or client-side-rendered Next.js websites are supported. The short answer is *no*.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'When talking about "serverless functions," we refer to a single function (written
    in any programming language) that gets invoked on a managed infrastructure. In
    fact, it''s called "serverless" because we just have to write the function without
    really thinking about the server executing it. Unlike traditional servers, where
    we typically pay an hourly rate (for example, we could pay $1 for every hour,
    even when the server is not processing any data), serverless functions have a
    different pricing model: we pay them a fraction of a cent for each execution,
    depending on the execution duration, memory usage, and other similar metrics.
    For example, at the time of writing, AWS Lambda (the most popular serverless environment)
    costs *$0.20 for every million requests* and $0.0000000021 for every millisecond
    of duration (when allocated 128 MB of memory). As you can imagine, this pricing
    model can be really attractive compared to more traditional alternatives, as you
    only pay for what you actually use.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    deploying a Next.js application, so we don't have to worry about them; we just
    have to concentrate on the web application we're building.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Vercel is probably one of the easiest ones. Also, it allows you to gain access
    to the analytics module (do you remember we talked about it in [*Chapter 10*](B16985_10_Final_SB_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor102),
    *Working with SEO and Managing Performance?*), which can be incredibly useful
    to measure frontend performances over time. That will help us keep an eye on frontend
    optimization, which other platforms don't do (also, it's something fundamental!).

    to a geographically distributed network of data centers used to achieve high availability
    and performance when serving content to users in any part of the world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and I want my web application to be used in potentially any part of the world.
    So, where should I host it from a geographical point of view?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certain providers, such as Amazon AWS, DigitalOcean, and Microsoft Azure (and
    many more), will let you choose a specific data center to serve your application
    from. For example, I could select AWS *eu-south-1* (Milan, Italy), *ap-northeast-2*
    (Seoul, South Korea), or *sa-east-1* (São Paulo, Brazil). If I choose to serve
    my web application from Milan, Italian users will notice a very low latency when
    trying to reach the web application; it is geographically located very close to
    them. The same could happen for French, Swiss, and German users, but for people
    living in Asia, Africa, or the Americas, it will be the opposite. The further
    you are from the data center, the greater the latency, leading to lousy performance,
    poor client-to-server request latency, and so on. If we think of static assets,
    such as images, CSS, or JavaScript files, this will be even clearer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    be replicated across all the regions in the network, making it available closer
    to your users in any part of the world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you look at Next.js' statically generated websites, you will quickly notice
    that there is no need for a server to render the pages at request time. Instead,
    the website is entirely generated and statically rendered at build time, so we
    eventually end up with a collection of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
    that can be deployed to a CDN.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    possible performances by serving static HTML pages from a CDN. But which CDN should

    alternatives. Prominent players in this area are (but are not limited to) *Amazon
    AWS*, *Microsoft Azure CDN*, and *Cloudflare*. Of course, there are many other
    alternatives, but these are the ones I've tried and had great experiences with,
    so I feel confident recommending them to you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to achieve the best possible performance might be worth it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Talking about AWS, for instance, the procedure won't be as straightforward as
    the Vercel one. We would need to build a pipeline (with either GitHub Actions
    or GitLab Pipelines, and so on) to statically generate the web application, then
    to push it to **AWS S3** (a service used for storing static assets), and eventually
    use a **CloudFront** (AWS CDN) distribution to let users reach these static assets
    over HTTP requests. We would also need to link our CloudFront distribution to
    a domain name, and we can do that using **AWS Route 53** (an AWS proprietary DNS
    service).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cloudflare, in comparison, makes things a bit easier. It has a more straightforward
    UI, called Cloudflare Pages, that can help us link our project to a Git repository
    and automatically deploy a new website version every time we push new code to
    any branch. Of course, every time we push some code to the main branch, it will
    be published in production; if we want to preview some features living on feature
    branches, we can just push our code there and wait for Cloudflare to publish a
    preview deployment, just like Vercel does.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Microsoft Azure provides another exciting approach. We can enter the Azure portal
    (the Azure administration dashboard), create a new resource, select "static web
    app" as the resource type, and enter the required data to configure it. After
    that, we can link our GitHub account, making automatic deployments available just
    like we did on Cloudflare and Vercel. Azure will create a GitHub workflow file
    for us so the build phase will run on GitHub and push the content to Azure as
    soon as it succeeds.

- en: AWS, for instance, might look like the most complicated one. But if we already
    have an AWS infrastructure, it would make things easier for us to set up a deployment
    there. The same applies to Microsoft Azure, where we might already have existing
    projects running on this platform, and we don't want to move just one web application
    outside of it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cloudflare, instead, can be the perfect solution for all static websites that
    don't need to rely on other services, except for serverless functions (Cloudflare
    offers a serverless function service called Cloudflare Workers) and other similar
    services that you can find at https://developers.cloudflare.com.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though there are ways to execute serverless functions decoupled from the
    static website (by using AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Cloudflare Workers, and
    so on), there are times when we need to create dozens or even hundreds of serverless
    functions. Organizing such deployments can be challenging, especially if we're
    working in a small team without support from someone who's really into DevOps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is to consider the following aspect: how big is the team I''m working in? While
    solutions such as Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, and Cloudflare are well suited for
    both little and big teams, there are other providers where the required knowledge,
    skillset, and capacity are way higher. Setting up an AWS EC2 instance or a custom
    machine on DigitalOcean or Google Cloud gives us much more control over the whole
    application life cycle, but the cost (in terms of configuration, setup, and required
    time) is considerable.'

    a custom cloud infrastructure. If we're doing that, we should make sure we're
    not unintentionally reinventing the wheel by recreating infrastructures that Vercel,
    Netlify, Cloudflare, and so on can provide even on a free plan.

    also know how to choose a deployment platform for any need.
