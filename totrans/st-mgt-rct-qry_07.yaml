  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SSR is a process that allows you to render your application on the server instead
    of the browser. During this process, the server sends the rendered page to the
    client. The client then makes the page fully interactive through a process called
    hydration.
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Owing to the possibility of using SSR, one of the things that might make sense
    to do is fetch your data on the server. This has many advantages, but one of the
    best is giving your users their pages with the initial data already loaded. Now,
    just because you are loading data on the server side doesn’t invalidate the scenarios
    in which you might need to fetch your data on the client side. If your page contains
    frequently updated data on the client side, React Query continues to be your best
    friend.

  id: totrans-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The short answer is no. If we did that, we would just be wasting memory on the
    server and not leveraging the advantages of SSR. What we can do instead is prefetch
    our data on the server side and feed it to React Query so that it can manage it
    on the client side. That way, when the user gets the page, the page will already
    have the data the user needs, and from that point on, React Query takes care of
    everything.

- en: Given that we returned `dehydratedState` from our `loader` function, this will
    be picked up by `useDehydratedState` and passed to our `Hydrate` wrapper, wrapping
    our component. This means that React Query will pick up `dehydratedState`, hydrate
    it, and merge this new data with the current data in `QueryClient`. Due to this
    process, when the hook inside `Index` first runs, it will already have the data
    that we prefetched from `loader`.

  zh: 由于我们从`loader`函数中返回了`dehydratedState`，这将由`useDehydratedState`捕获并传递给我们的`Hydrate`包装器，包裹我们的组件。这意味着React
    Query将捕获`dehydratedState`，对其进行解冻，并将这些新数据与`QueryClient`中当前的数据合并。由于这个过程，当`Index`内部的钩子第一次运行时，它已经拥有了从`loader`中预取的数据。

- en: You learned how React Query enables you to prefetch data on the server and send
    it to React Query on the client side. To do this, you got to know two patterns,
    `initialData` and `hydrate`. In the `initialData` pattern, you prefetch the data
    on the server and pass it to the `initialData` option in the `useQuery` hook on
    the client side. In the `hydrate` pattern, you prefetch your query on the server,
    dehydrate the query cache, and hydrate it on the client side.

  zh: 你学习了如何使用React Query在服务器端预取数据并将其发送到客户端的React Query。为此，你需要了解两种模式，`initialData`和`hydrate`。在`initialData`模式中，你在服务器端预取数据并将其传递到客户端`useQuery`钩子的`initialData`选项中。在`hydrate`模式中，你在服务器端预取查询，解冻查询缓存，并在客户端进行解冻。
