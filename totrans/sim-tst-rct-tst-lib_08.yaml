    actions on the DOM, such as **keydown** and **keyup** events.

    by intercepting the request before it reaches the internet and instead returns
    controllable mock data for testing.

- en: A mock function is a test double used to make assertions. For example, we can
    use a mock function to verify that a method is called when a user clicks a button.

- en: The risk is that substituting actual dependencies with mocked versions to test
    components doesn't allow you to test resulting behaviors when integrated with
    real production dependencies.

- en: Use a `getBy*` query when you expect an element to be present in the DOM's current
    state. Use a `findBy*` query when an element's presence depends on an asynchronous
    action that delays the time the element appears in the DOM. Use a `queryBy*` query
    when you want to verify that an element is not present in the DOM.

- en: Testing integrated components allow you to mitigate risk by verifying production
    behavior when components interact with each other. Using the isolated approach,
    we would be replacing real dependencies with fake data and responses and, therefore,
    not mitigate as much risk. Also, in many situations, you can cover more code in
    fewer tests using the integrated testing approach.

- en: You should only use the `data-testid` attribute as the last resort when other
    preferred queries methods such as `getBy*` and `findBy*` cannot be used to select
    elements.

- en: The `act` method ensures your tests behave closer to how React updates the browser's
    DOM. Use `act` in situations where you need to manually make component updates
    such as resolving a Promise that React otherwise would not be aware of in your
    test. React Testing Library automatically wraps components in `act` eliminating
    the need to manually wrap all code that updates the component in most scenarios,
    such as click events.

    that avoid implementation details and resemble DOM interactions from the end user's
    perspective.

    as you add new code quickly. Running tests in Watch Mode is also beneficial when
    using the TDD approach to building components.
