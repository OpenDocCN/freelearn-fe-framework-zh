- en: Angular is a popular JavaScript framework that can run on a broad range of platforms,
    including web, desktop, and mobile. It has an array of rich features right out
    of the box and a wide range of tools that makes it popular among developers. This
    updated third edition of Angular Projects will teach you how to build efficient
    and optimized web applications using Angular.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will start by exploring the essential features of the framework by creating
    10 different real-world web applications. Each application will demonstrate how
    to integrate Angular with a different library and tool. As you advance, you will
    learn how to implement popular technologies such as Angular Router, Scully, Electron,
    Angular’s service worker, Nx’s monorepo tools, NgRx, and more while building an
    issue tracking system, a PWA weather application, a mobile photo geotagging application,
    a component UI library, and many other exciting projects. In the concluding chapters,
    you’ll get to grips with customizing Angular CLI commands using schematics.

- en: If you are a developer who has beginner-level experience with Angular and you’re
    looking to become well versed in the essential tools for dealing with the various
    use cases you may encounter with Angular, then this Angular development book is
    for you. Beginner-level knowledge of web application development and basic experience
    of working with ES6 or TypeScript are assumed.

- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Creating Your First Web Application in Angular*, explores the
    main features of the Angular framework and teaches you about the basic building
    blocks that comprise a typical Angular application. You will investigate the different
    tools and IDE extensions that are available in the Angular ecosystem to enhance
    the developer’s workflow and experience.'

    looks at how an Angular application is based on the **Single-Page Application**
    (**SPA**) architecture, where typically we have multiple pages that are served
    by different URLs or routes. On the other hand, Jamstack is a hot technology that
    is emerging and allows you to build fast, static websites and serve them directly
    from a CDN. In this chapter, we will use the Angular Router to implement routing
    functionality in an Angular application. We will also use Scully, the best static
    site generator for Angular, to create a personal blog that embraces the Jamstack
    architecture.'

- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Building an Issue Tracking System Using Reactive Forms*, is where
    we build an issue tracking management system and use Angular reactive forms to
    add new issues to the system. We will design our forms using Clarity Components
    from VMware, and we will incorporate built-in and custom validations. We will
    also react to value changes in the forms and take actions accordingly.'

- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Building a PWA Weather Application Using Angular Service Worker*,
    covers how the user experience of a web application is not the same for all users,
    especially in places with poor network coverage and connectivity. When we build
    a web application, we should take into account all sorts of network types. In
    this chapter, we will create an application that uses the OpenWeather API to display
    the weather of a specified region. We will learn how to deploy the application
    to Firebase Hosting. We will also explore PWA techniques using the Angular service
    worker to provide a seamless user experience when offline.'

    cross-platform JavaScript framework for building desktop applications using web
    technologies. When combined with Angular, it can yield really performant apps.
    In this chapter, we will create a WYSIWYG editor that can run on the desktop.
    We will build an Angular application and integrate it with ngx-wig, a popular
    WYSIWYG Angular library, and we will use Electron to package it as a desktop application.
    Data is persisted locally in the filesystem using a Node.js API.'

- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Building a Mobile Photo Geotagging Application Using Capacitor
    and 3D Maps,* covers Capacitor, a service provided by the Ionic framework that
    turns any web application, such as one created with Angular, into a native one.
    Its main advantage is that we can build a native mobile application and a web
    app using the same code base. Cesium is a popular JavaScript framework for building
    3D maps. In this chapter, we will use Capacitor to build a geotagging mobile application
    for our photos. We will use various Ionic plugins to take a photo in a specified
    location and persist it to Cloud Firestore. We will then display a list of all
    photos taken inside the Cesium 3D viewer.'

    dives into **Search Engine Optimization** (**SEO**), a critical aspect for any
    website nowadays. Who doesn’t want their website to look good when sharing it
    via social media? The real challenge for client web applications is to optimize
    it, which can be accomplished by rendering content on the server. In this chapter,
    we will learn how to create a GitHub portfolio application using the GitHub API.
    We will then render it on the server and learn how to transfer the state to the
    browser. We will also see how to set the page title and additional metadata dynamically.'

    covers monorepo architecture, which is a popular technique for when working with
    multiple applications under a single repository, giving speed and flexibility
    to the development process. In this chapter, we will use Nx monorepo development
    tools to create two portals: one for the end user, in which they will be able
    to select a **Point of Interest** (**POI**) and visit it on a map, and another
    for admins to check on visit statistics for a given POI. Application state is
    managed using NgRx.'

    CDK*, addresses how enterprise organizations usually need custom UI libraries
    that can be used across different web applications. The Angular CDK provides a
    broad range of functionalities for creating accessible and high-performing UI
    components. In this chapter, we will create two different components using the
    Angular CDK and the Bulma CSS framework. We will also package them as a single
    Angular library and learn how to publish them on npm, so that they can be re-used
    in different apps. We will also investigate how we can use each component as an
    Angular element.'

- en: '*Chapter 10*, *Customizing Angular CLI Commands Using Schematics*, covers how
    organizations usually follow different guidelines when it comes to creating Angular
    entities such as components or services. Angular schematics can assist them by
    extending Angular CLI commands and providing custom automation. In this chapter,
    we will learn how to use the Angular schematics API to build our own set of commands
    for generating components and services. We will build a schematic for creating
    an Angular component that contains the Tailwind CSS framework. We will also build
    an Angular service that uses the built-in HTTP client by default.'
