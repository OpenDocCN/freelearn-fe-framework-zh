Wikipedia defines SEO as "the process of affecting the online visibility of a website or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid results—often referred to as "natural", "organic", or "earned" results." Optimizing your app for search engines means your app is more visible on the internet and can drive more revenue for you or your client. Angular provides built-in features that can be leveraged to ensure our apps enjoy maximum visibility on the web.</p><p>In this book, you will learn how to use Angular to create a progressive web app (PWA) that has great support for SEO. This learning journey begins by identifying what makes an app SEO friendly and installing Angular CLI. You will then build out the UI components and the application components. By the end of the first lesson, you will have an app ready that is built using Angular's best practices. In the remaining two lessons, you will implement server-side rendering and service workers in your app. You will create the server app, implement an Express server, and add dynamic metadata to your app. Finally, you will configure service workers and test the offline capabilities of your app.</p><p>By the end of this book, you will be equipped to create modern, SEO-friendly web apps with best practices using Angular CLI.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Creating the Base Application">Lesson 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating the Base Application</em></span>, shows how to install Angular CLI and create the Angular application that will be used in this book. We will set a few default settings and configure our global styles with Bootstrap and Font Awesome. We will then create the basic UI and layout of our app.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Creating the Application Module and Components">Lesson 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating the Application Module and Components</em></span>, explains the different types of components such as presentational components and container components. We will then see how to create PostsComponent, ProfileComponent, PostListComponent, PostItemComponent, and ProfileItemComponent. Finally, we will create resolvers to retrieve data using the router.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Server-Side Rendering">Lesson 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Server-Side Rendering</em></span>, shows how to add server-side rendering to our application. We will start by generating the server app and adding its dependencies. We will then add scripts to our package.json file, before implementing a web server in Express.js. Lastly, we will see how to add dynamic metadata to our pages.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Service Workers">Lesson 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Service Workers</em></span>, shows how to work with service workers. We will start by installing the required dependencies. We will then move on to enabling the service worker, configuring it, testing it, and finally debugging it.</p><p>This book will require the following minimum hardware requirements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Processor: i3</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Memory: 2 GB RAM</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Hard disk: 10 GB</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Internet connection</li></ul></div><p>Throughout this book, we will be using Node and npm to run our development environment, which is based on Angular CLI. Additionally, Git is needed in order to retrieve content from GitHub. Please ensure you have the following installed on your machine:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Node 6.9.0 or higher</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">npm 3.0 or higher</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Git</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Checking the Version"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec04"/>Checking the Version</h1></div></div></div><p>We can check if our machine meets the requirements by checking the version of Node, npm, and Git. This can be done using the following commands:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">node –v
npm –v
git --version</pre></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Development API"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec05"/>Development API</h1></div></div></div><p>This book focuses on building an Angular application that functions as a public website. It will retrieve the content from a REST API to match real-life use cases as close as possible. The development API can be downloaded from GitHub and installed on local machines from</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Installation of the API"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec06"/>Installation of the API</h1></div></div></div><p> To install the API, run the following commands:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">$ git clone &lt;repo_url&gt;
$ cd packt-angular-seo-api
$ npm install
$ npm start</pre></div><p> If all went well, you should see the following message in the terminal:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">Web server listening at: http://localhost:3000
Browse your REST API at http://localhost:3000/explorer</pre></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Who This Book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch0111lvl2sec07"/>Who This Book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is ideal for experienced front-end developers who are looking to quickly work through an intelligent example that demonstrates all the key features of server-side development with Angular. You'll need some prior exposure to Angular, as we skim over the basics and get straight to work.  </p><p>You must also be well-versed with the following concepts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Basics of Angular</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">HTML</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">CSS</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Basics of TypeScript</li></ul></div></div>
