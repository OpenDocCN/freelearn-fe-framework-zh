- en: In this final part of the book, you will first learn about the rules of Hooks,
    serving as the basis for creating your own Hooks. Then, you will learn in depth
    how to refactor our existing blog app code to use custom Hooks where it makes
    sense to do so. Finally, you will migrate an existing project from React class
    components to React Hooks and learn how the two solutions compare.
