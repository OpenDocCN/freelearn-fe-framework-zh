    <h1 id="_idParaDest-341" class="heading-1">Setting Up Your Development Environment</h1>
    <p class="normal">Sharing a consistent<a id="_idIndexMarker1210"/> development environment between you and your team members is important. Consistency helps to avoid many IT-related issues, including ongoing maintenance, licensing, and upgrade costs. Further, you want to ensure the entire team has the same development experience. This way, if a team member runs into a configuration issue, other team members can help resolve the issue. Creating a frustration-free and efficient onboarding experience for a new team member is also essential.</p>
    <p class="normal">Easy and well-documented onboarding procedures ensure that new team members can quickly become productive and be integrated into the team. On an ongoing basis, achieving a consistent and minimal development environment remains challenging for teams. Automation can help deliver and maintain a consistent environment across developer machines.</p>
    <p class="normal">The recommended operating systems are Windows 10 or Windows 11 Pro with PowerShell v7+ and Developer Mode enabled or macOS Ventura or Sonoma with Terminal and XCode developer tools installed. It is recommended to use the Chromium-based Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge as a web browser because they offer almost identical developer experience.</p>
    <p class="normal">Most of the suggested software in this book are cross-platform tools, so they also work on Linux systems. However, your experience may vary with these systems.</p>
    <p class="normal">This appendix covers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Recommended web development tools</li>
      <li class="bulletList">CLI package managers</li>

      <li class="bulletList">Project setup with the Angular CLI</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Optimizing VS Code for Angular</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start by reviewing the recommended web development tools and how you can quickly install these tools via automation scripts. Later in the appendix, we will go over how you can create such scripts.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-342" class="heading-1">Recommended web development tools</h1>

    </ol>
    <p class="normal">By <a id="_idIndexMarker1232"/>executing this script, you have successfully set up your development environment on Mac. Here is an example of a more sophisticated install and verify routine, where you can check to see if a particular program, like <code class="inlineCode">brew </code>or <code class="inlineCode">node</code>, is already installed, before attempting to install them:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">echo "Checking if brew is installed" which -s brew

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ Homebrew/install/master/install)" &lt; /dev/null
else
echo "Found brew"
fi
echo "Checking for Node version ${NODE_VERSION}" node -v | grep ${NODE_VERSION}
if [[ $? != 0 ]] ; then
echo "Installing Node version ${NODE_VERSION}" brew install nodejs
else
echo "Found Node version ${NODE_VERSION}"
fi
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">By now, you <a id="_idIndexMarker1233"/>should have a good idea of what automating the execution of your scripts looks like. However, the harsh reality is that these scripts do not represent a highly capable or resilient solution. They can’t be executed or managed remotely, nor can they quickly recover from errors or survive machine boot cycles. Moreover, your IT requirements may exceed what is covered here.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you’re dealing with large teams and experiencing frequent staff turnover, an automation tool can be extremely beneficial. Conversely, if you’re working alone or part of a smaller, more stable team, such a tool might be overkill. I encourage you to explore tools such as Puppet, Chef, Ansible, and Vagrant to help you decide which best fits your needs, or to determine if a simple script would suffice.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-349" class="heading-1">Project setup with the Angular CLI</h1>
    <p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker1234"/>Angular CLI tool, <code class="inlineCode">ng</code>, is <a id="_idIndexMarker1235"/>an official Angular project to ensure that newly created Angular applications have a uniform architecture, following <a id="_idIndexMarker1236"/>the best practices perfected by the community over time.

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-350" class="heading-2">Setting up your development directory</h2>
    <p class="normal">Setting up a <a id="_idIndexMarker1238"/>dedicated <code class="inlineCode">dev</code> directory is a lifesaver. Since all the data under this directory is backed up using GitHub, you can safely configure your antivirus, cloud sync, or backup software to ignore it. This helps significantly reduce CPU, disk, and network utilization. As a full-stack developer, you’re likely to be multitasking a lot, so avoiding unnecessary activity has a net positive impact on performance, power, and data consumption daily, especially if your development environment is a laptop that is resource-starved or you wish to squeeze as much battery life as possible when you’re on the move.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">Creating a <code class="inlineCode">dev</code> folder directly in the <code class="inlineCode">c:\</code> drive is very important on Windows. Earlier versions of Windows, or rather NTFS, can’t handle file paths longer than 260 characters. This may seem adequate at first, but when you install <code class="inlineCode">npm</code> packages in a folder structure that is already deep in the hierarchy, the <code class="inlineCode">node_modules</code> folder structure can get deep enough to hit this limit very easily.</p>
      <p class="normal">With <code class="inlineCode">npm 3+</code>, a new, flatter package installation strategy was introduced, which helps with npm-related issues, but being as close to the root folder as possible helps tremendously with any tool.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Create your <code class="inlineCode">dev</code> folder <a id="_idIndexMarker1239"/>using the following commands. For Windows:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con"><span class="hljs-con-meta">PS</span>&gt; mkdir c:\dev
<span class="hljs-con-meta">PS</span>&gt; cd c:\dev
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">For macOS:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con"><span class="hljs-con-meta">$</span> mkdir ~/dev
<span class="hljs-con-meta">$</span> cd ~/dev
</code></pre>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">In Unix-based operating systems, <code class="inlineCode">~</code> (pronounced tilde) is a shortcut to the current user’s home directory, which resides under <code class="inlineCode">/Users/ your-user-name</code>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Now that your development directory is ready, let’s start generating your Angular application.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-351" class="heading-2">Generating your Angular application</h2>
    <p class="normal">We will be using the npm create command to generate your Angular application, which uses the Angular CLI to generate the code. The Angular CLI goes beyond initial code generation; you’ll use it frequently to create new components, directives, pipes, services, modules, and more. The Angular CLI also helps during development with live-reloading features so that you can quickly see the results of your changes. The Angular CLI can also test, lint, and build optimized <a id="_idIndexMarker1240"/>versions of your code for a production release. Furthermore, as new Angular versions are released, the Angular CLI helps you upgrade your code by automatically rewriting portions to remain compatible with potential breaking changes.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-352" class="heading-3">Installing the Angular CLI</h3>
    <p class="normal">The<a id="_idIndexMarker1241"/> documentation at <a href="https://angular.dev/tools/cli"><span class="url">https://angular.dev/tools/cli</span></a> guides you on how to install <code class="inlineCode">@angular/cli</code> as a global npm package. However, I advise against doing this. Over time, as the Angular CLI is upgraded, keeping the global and in-project versions in sync becomes a constant irritant. If they’re not aligned, the tool tends to complain endlessly. Additionally, if you’re working on multiple projects, you end up with varying versions of the Angular CLI over time. As a result, your commands may not return the results you expect, or the results that your team members are getting.</p>
    <p class="normal">The strategy detailed in the next section introduces a bit more complexity to the initial configuration of your Angular project. However, you’ll more than make up for this pain if you must return to a project a few months or even a year later. In that case, you could use the version of the tool that you last used on the project, instead of some future version that may require upgrades that you’re not willing to perform. In the next section, you’ll use this best practice to initialize your Angular app.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-353" class="heading-3">Initializing your Angular app</h3>
    <p class="normal">The main <a id="_idIndexMarker1242"/>way to initialize your app<a id="_idIndexMarker1243"/> is by using the Angular CLI. Let’s initialize the application for development:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Under your <code class="inlineCode">dev</code> folder, execute:
        <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">npm create @angular
</code></pre>
        <div class="packt_tip">
          <p class="normal">Angular creates all new projects using the standalone project configuration.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="2">Follow the on-screen instructions and name your app <code class="inlineCode">my-test-app</code>; otherwise, accept the default option by pressing <strong class="keyWord">Enter</strong>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">On your terminal, you should see a success message.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Your project <a id="_idIndexMarker1244"/>folder <code class="inlineCode">my-test-app</code> has<a id="_idIndexMarker1245"/> been initialized as a Git repository and scaffolded with an initial file and folder structure.</p>
    <p class="normal">The alias for <code class="inlineCode">@angular/cli</code> is <code class="inlineCode">ng</code>. If you were to install the Angular CLI globally, you would execute <code class="inlineCode">ng new my-test-app</code>, but we didn’t do this. To use the Angular CLI, you would have to run it as <code class="inlineCode">npx @angular/cli</code>. However, we just installed the Angular CLI under the <code class="inlineCode">node_modules/.bin</code> directory of your app, i.e., the <code class="inlineCode">my-test-app</code> directory. This means you can run <code class="inlineCode">ng</code> commands as <code class="inlineCode">npx ng</code> in the <code class="inlineCode">apps</code> directory using the version attached to your project, such as <code class="inlineCode">npx ng generate component</code> <code class="inlineCode">my-new-component</code>, and continue working efficiently.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-354" class="heading-2">Optimizing VS Code for Angular</h2>
    <p class="normal">It’s essential to<a id="_idIndexMarker1246"/> optimize your <strong class="keyWord">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">IDE</strong>) to have a great development experience. If <a id="_idIndexMarker1247"/>you leverage the automated tools I present in this section, you can quickly configure your IDE and Angular project with dozens of settings that work well together.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-355" class="heading-2">Configuring your project automatically</h2>
    <p class="normal">To quickly <a id="_idIndexMarker1248"/>configure your Angular application and VS Code workspace, run the following commands:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Apply the Angular VS Code configuration:
        <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">npx mrm angular-vscode
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">Apply the <code class="inlineCode">npm</code> scripts for Docker configuration:
        <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">npx mrm npm-docker
</code></pre>
      
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">These settings are constantly tweaked to adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of extensions, plugins, Angular, and VS Code. Always make sure to install a fresh version of the task by rerunning the <code class="inlineCode">install</code> command to get the latest version.</p>
    </div></li>
    </ol>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="3">Execute <code class="inlineCode">npm run style:fix</code>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Execute <code class="inlineCode">npm run lint:fix</code>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">For more <a id="_idIndexMarker1249"/>information on the <code class="inlineCode">mrm</code> tasks, refer to:</p>

    </ul>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">You may verify your configuration against the sample projects on GitHub. However, note that the configuration pieces will be applied at the root of the repository and not under the <code class="inlineCode">projects</code> folder.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Congratulations – you’re done setting up your development environment!</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-356" class="heading-1">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this appendix, you mastered using CLI-based package managers for both Windows and macOS to speed up and automate the setup of development environments for you and your colleagues. You also created your first Angular project and optimized its configuration for development using Visual Studio Code. You then implemented automated style checkers and fixers to enforce coding standards and styling across your team. The lint checker and fixer you implemented will automatically catch potential coding errors and maintainability issues.</p>
    <p class="normal">The automated scripts you created codify your team norms and document them for new and existing members. By reducing variance from one developer’s environment to the next, your team can overcome any individual configuration issue more efficiently and remain focused on executing the task at hand. With a collective understanding of a common environment, no single individual on the team carries the burden of having to help troubleshoot everyone else’s issues. The same idea applies to the shape and style of your code files.</p>
    <p class="normal">When a team member looks at another team member’s code, it looks stylistically identical, which makes it easier to troubleshoot and debug an issue. As a result, your team is more productive. By leveraging more sophisticated and resilient tools, mid-to-large sized organizations can achieve considerable savings in their IT budgets.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-357" class="heading-1">Further reading</h1>
    <p class="normal">The article <em class="italic">Automating the Setup of the Local Developer Machine</em> by Vishwas Parameshwarappa is a great place to start for using Vagrant, found at <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com"><span class="url">https://www.vagrantup.com</span></a>.

    <p class="normal">Other tools include Chef at <a href="https://www.chef.io"><span class="url">https://www.chef.io</span></a>, and Puppet at <a href="https://puppet.com"><span class="url">https://puppet.com</span></a>. Some developers prefer to work within Docker containers during coding at <a href="https://www.docker.com"><span class="url">https://www.docker.com</span></a>. This is done to isolate different versions of SDKs from each other. Specific development tools cannot be scoped to a given folder and must be installed globally or OS-wide, making it difficult to work on multiple projects simultaneously. I recommend avoiding this type of setup if you can. I expect IDEs will automate such chores in the future, as CPU core counts increase and virtualization tech gains better hardware acceleration.</p>
